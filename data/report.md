| 31241782 | Low                   | The text states that patients were randomly assigned to either the static CAIS group or the freehand surgery group.            | Unclear/Some Concerns                          | The text mentions potential deviations in implant position due to factors like imprecision in imaging, surgical guide fabrication, and human error. It's unclear how these deviations were addressed or minimized during the study. | Unclear/Some Concerns        | The text doesn't provide information about the number of patients who dropped out of the study or reasons for any dropout. This makes it difficult to assess the risk of attrition bias.                                               | Low                                | The text describes a standardized method for measuring implant position deviations using CBCT imaging and coDiagnostiX software. The same dentist who conducted virtual implant planning performed all measurements, minimizing potential inter-rater variability. | Unclear/Some Concerns                    | The text doesn't explicitly mention any pre-specified outcome measures or analyses. It's unclear whether selective reporting of results could have influenced the findings.                                                           | nan                    | nan                                                                                                                                                                     | nan                    | nan                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 32249446 | Low                   | The study mentions computer-generated random numbers and minimization for cigarette smoking to ensure balanced groups.         | Unclear/Some Concerns                          | The text states three subjects in the test group exited due to extraction, suggesting potential deviations. However, the reason for these extractions (inadequate improvement) needs further clarification.                         | Unclear/Some Concerns        | Four subjects were lost to follow-up after 6 and 7 years. While reasons are given, the potential impact of missing data on the overall results requires assessment.                                                                    | Low                                | The description specifies standardized methods for assessing outcomes like clinical parameters, complications, and patient-reported outcomes using validated tools (OHIP-14) and clear definitions.                                                                | Unclear/Some Concerns                    | While the paper mentions 10-year follow-up data, it's unclear if all collected data were included.

| 34664294 | Low                   | The text states that patients were 'randomly assigned' to one of three groups using a computer-generated random number system. | Unclear/Some Concerns                          | The text mentions that some samples were excluded due to low sequencing reads, but it doesn't specify if these exclusions were related to deviations from the protocol. Further details about reasons for exclusion are needed.     | Unclear/Some Concerns        | The text states that some samples were excluded due to low sequencing reads, but it's unclear if this relates to patient dropout or incomplete data collection.  More information is needed about the rationale for excluding samples. | Unclear/Some Concerns              | While the text describes methods for collecting and analyzing microbiome data, it lacks details about blinding procedures for outcome assessment. It's unclear if assessors were blinded to treatment allocation.                                                  | Unclear/Some Concerns                    | The text mentions that p-values were not corrected for multiple comparisons, which raises concerns about potential publication bias.

It's unclear if this loss is related to deviations from the intended interventions.                             | Unclear/Some Concerns        | One patient was lost to follow-up in the antibiotic group. The study states there was no implant failure or infection at the first follow-up, but it's unclear if this missing data could influence the overall results.               | Unclear/Some Concerns              | The description of how implant failure and infections were measured is somewhat vague. More details about the criteria used for diagnosis would be helpful to assess for potential bias.                                                                           | Unclear/Some Concerns                    | The study focused on implant failure as the primary outcome. It's possible that other outcomes were measured but not reported, which could lead to reporting bias.

This raises concerns about potential reporting bias.                                    | Low                    | The text mentions 4 implants lost due to disease progression out of 147. While attrition occurred, it's relatively low and likely not impactful on the overall results. | Unclear/Some Concerns  | Two trained and blinded investigators assessed MBLs. This suggests efforts to minimize detection bias, but details on blinding for other outcome measures (e.g., probing depth) are unclear. |
