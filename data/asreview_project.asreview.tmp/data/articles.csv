The aim of this study was to compare periodontal regeneration (PR) with tooth extraction and replacement (TER) in a population with attachment loss to or beyond the apex of the root in terms of professional, patient-reported and economic outcomes. This was a 10-year randomized controlled clinical trial. 50 stage III or stage IV periodontitis subjects with a severely compromised tooth with attachment loss to or beyond the apex were randomized to PR or TER with either an implant- or a tooth-supported fixed partial denture. Subjects were kept on a strict periodontal supportive care regimen every 3 months and examined yearly. Survival and recurrence analysis were performed. 88% and 100% survival rates were observed in the PR and TER groups. Complication-free survival was not significantly different: 6.7-9.1 years for PR and 7.3-9.1 years for TER (p = .788). In PR, the observed 10-year attachment gain was 7.3 ± 2.3 mm and the residual probing depths were 3.4 ± 0.8 mm. Recurrence analysis showed that the 95% confidence interval of the costs was significantly lower for PR compared with TER throughout the whole 10-year period. Patient-reported outcomes and oral health-related quality-of-life measurements improved in both groups. Periodontal regeneration can change the prognosis of hopeless teeth and is a less costly alternative to tooth extraction and replacement. The complexity of the treatment limits widespread application to the most complex cases but provides powerful proof of principle for the benefits of PR in deep intra-bony defect.",
34664294,10.1111/jcpe.13566,The microbiome of dental and peri-implant subgingival plaque during peri-implant mucositis therapy: A randomized clinical trial.,Journal of clinical periodontology,2022,"To assess the microbial effects of mechanical debridement in conjunction with a mouthrinse on sites with peri-implant mucositis and gingivitis. Eighty-nine patients with peri-implant mucositis were included in a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with mechanical debridement and 1-month use of either delmopinol, chlorhexidine (CHX), or a placebo mouthrinse. Submucosal and subgingival plaque samples of implants and teeth were collected at baseline and after 1 and 3 months, processed for 16S V4 rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and analysed bioinformatically. The sites with peri-implant mucositis presented with a less diverse and less anaerobic microbiome. Exposure to delmopinol or CHX, but not to the placebo mouthrinse resulted in microbial changes after 1 month. The healthy sites around the teeth harboured a more diverse and more anaerobe-rich microbiome than the healthy sites around the implants. Peri-implant sites with mucositis harbour ecologically less complex and less anaerobic biofilms with lower biomass than patient-matched dental sites with gingivitis while eliciting an equal inflammatory response. Adjunctive antimicrobial therapy in addition to mechanical debridement does affect both dental and peri-implant biofilm composition in the short term, resulting in a less dysbiotic subgingival biofilm.",

In this multicenter randomized clinical trial, 138 patients (147 implants) with peri-implantitis were treated surgically, randomized by coin toss to either a control (access flap surgery) or a test group (reconstructive surgery using bone substitute material). Clinical assessments, including probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding and suppuration on probing (BOP & SOP) as well as soft tissue recession (REC), were recorded at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Marginal bone levels (MBL), measured on intra-oral radiographs, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were recorded at baseline and 12 months. No blinding to group allocation was performed. The primary outcome at 12 months was a composite measure including (i) implant not lost, (ii) absence of BOP/SOP at all aspects, (iii) PPD ≤5 mm at all aspects and (iv) ≤1 mm recession of mucosal margin on the buccal aspect of the implant. Secondary outcomes included (i) changes of MBL, (ii) changes of PPD, BOP%, and buccal KM, (iii) buccal REC and (iv) patient-reported outcomes. During follow-up, four implants (one in the test group, three in the control group) in four patients were removed due to disease progression. At 12 months, a total of 69 implants in the test and 68 implants in the control group were examined. Thus, 16.4% and 13.5% of implants in the test and control group, respectively, met all predefined criteria of the composite outcome. PPD reduction and MBL gain were 3.7 mm and about 1.0 mm in both groups. Reduction in mean BOP% varied between 45% (test) and 50% (control), without significant differences between groups. Buccal REC was less pronounced in the test group (M = 0.7, SD = 0.9 mm) when compared to controls (M = 1.1, SD = 1.5 mm). PROs were favorable in both groups without significant differences. One case of allergic reaction to the antibiotic therapy was recorded. No other adverse events were noted. Surgical therapy of peri-implantitis effectively improved the clinical and radiographic status at 12 months. While the use of a bone substitute material did not improve reductions of PPD and BOP, buccal REC was less pronounced in the test group. Patient satisfaction was high in both groups.",

Twenty-eight participants presenting with isolated non-molar implants exhibiting PSTDs were enrolled and randomized to receive either CAF or TUN, both with a connective tissue graft (CTG). The primary outcome of the study was the percentage of mean PSTD coverage at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included the frequency of complete PSTD coverage, changes in keratinized mucosa width (KMW) and horizontal mucosal thickness (MT), as assessed with transgingival probing, 3D optical scanning and ultrasonography, professional aesthetic evaluation and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). At 12 months, the mean PSTD coverage of the CAF and TUN groups was 90.23% and 59.76%, respectively (p = .03). CAF-treated sites showed a substantially higher frequency of complete PSTD coverage (p = .07), together with significantly greater gain of KMW (p = .01), increase in MT (p = .02), volumetric gain (p < .01) and professional aesthetic outcomes (p = .01). Both interventions showed an improvement in patient-reported aesthetics and a reduction of the anxiety related to the appearance of the implant compared to baseline, with the CAF group obtaining significantly higher scores (p = .03 for both PROMs). CAF + CTG resulted in superior PSTD coverage outcomes, greater gain in KMW and MT, and better PROMs than TUN + CTG for the treatment of isolated PSTDs (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03498911).",

35075765,10.1111/cid.13068,Effect of antibiotic prophylaxis in dental implant surgery: A multicenter placebo-controlled double-blinded randomized clinical trial.,Clinical implant dentistry and related research,2022,"The growing resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial medicines is a global issue and a direct threat to human health. Despite this, antibiotic prophylaxis is often still routinely used in dental implant surgery to prevent bacterial infection and early implant failure, despite unclear benefits. There is a lack of sufficient evidence to formulate clear clinical guidelines and therefore there is a need for well-designed, large-scale randomized controlled trials to determine the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis. To compare the effect of a presurgical antibiotic regimen with an identical placebo regimen in healthy or relatively healthy patients receiving dental implants. The 474 patients participating in the study were recruited from seven clinics in southern Sweden. We randomized the patients into a test and a placebo group; the study was conducted double-blinded. Preoperatively, the test group received 2 g of amoxicillin and the control group, identical placebo tablets. The primary outcome was implant failure; secondary outcomes were postoperative infections and adverse events. Patients were evaluated at two follow-ups: at 7-14 days and at 3-6 months. Postoperative evaluations of the antibiotic (n = 238) and the placebo (n = 235) groups noted implant failures (antibiotic group: six patients, 2.5% and placebo group: seven patients, 3.0%) and postoperative infections (antibiotic group: two patients, 0.8% and placebo group: five patients, 2.1%). No patient reported any adverse events. Between-group differences in implant failures and postoperative infections were nonsignificant. Antibiotic prophylaxis in conjunction with implant placement is likely of small benefit and should thus be avoided in most cases, especially given the unabated growth in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

31241782,10.1111/jcpe.13160,The accuracy of single-tooth implants placed using fully digital-guided surgery and freehand implant surgery.,Journal of clinical periodontology,2019,"This randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) aimed to compare the accuracy of implant positions between static computer-assisted implant surgery (CAIS) and freehand implant surgery in a single edentulous space. Sites with single edentulous spaces and neighbouring natural teeth were randomized into static CAIS or freehand implant surgery groups. In both groups, digital implant planning was performed using data from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and surface scans. In the static CAIS group, a surgical guide was produced and used for fully guided implant surgery, while in the freehand group, the implants were placed in a freehand manner. Postoperative CBCT was used for nine measurements representing the deviations in angles, implant shoulders and apexes between planned and actual implant positions. Fifty-two patients received 60 single implants. The median (IQR) deviations in angles, shoulders and apexes were 2.8 (2.6)°, 0.9 (0.8) mm and 1.2 (0.9) mm, respectively, in the static CAIS group, and 7.0 (7.0)°, 1.3 (0.7) mm and 2.2 (1.2) mm, respectively, in the freehand group. Statistically significant differences were found in 6 out of nine measured parameters using Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.05). Static CAIS provided more accuracy in implant positions than freehand placement in a single edentulous space.",
39181431,10.1016/j.jdent.2024.105317,Guided versus freehand single implant placement: A 3-year parallel randomized clinical trial.,Journal of dentistry,2024,"The present parallel randomized clinical trial aimed to assess, after a 3-year follow-up period, whether the choice of surgical technique-either manual or guided-and of the operator - non-expert operator or skilled - can affect the stability of peri‑implant marginal bone levels in implants placed 1 mm sub-crestal. Patients received platform-switched implants (Anyridge, MegaGen Implant Co., Gyeongbuk, South Korea) featuring a 5-degree internal conical connection and supporting single screw-retained fixed crowns. The implants were randomly assigned to be placed through a digitally static guided surgery procedure (Test group - GS) or a freehand surgical technique (Control Group - FH). A non-expert operator (fewer than 20 implants placed in his professional activity) was selected to perform procedures for the GS Group, while a skilled operator (with over 1000 implants placed in his professional activity) was chosen for the FH Group. Marginal bone level (MBL) was measured at prosthesis installation (t0) and at 1 (t1), 2 (t2) and 3 years (t3) of follow-up. Changes in MBL from t0 to t3 were analyzed through periapical radiographs. Moreover, MBL changes at all time points were correlated to different supra-crestal soft tissue heights (STH): less than 3 and ≥ 3 mm, respectively. 60 implants in 18 patients were examined, with 30 implants allocated to the GS group and 30 to the FH group. The difference in MBL change between the two groups was 0.11 ± 0.22 mm, which was not statistically significant (p = 0.61). At the time of prosthetic loading, the mean MBL for implants with STH less than 3 mm was 0.33 mm higher than implants with STH ≥ 3 mm, though this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.065). Digitally static guided implant placement, performed by a non-expert operator, does not limit marginal bone remodeling, when compared to a freehand procedure performed by an experienced operator. After correct and careful planning, early marginal bone levels (MBL) around conical connection, platform-switched implants placed sub-crestally may be stable in time. Digital planning and surgery have the potential to assist non-expert clinicians in achieving implant placements with comparable outcomes to those performed by experts.",
40702480,10.1186/s12903-025-06560-8,Patient-reported outcome measures comparing povidone iodine rinse and chlorhexidine rinse for dental implant therapy: a randomized controlled trial.,BMC oral health,2025,"To evaluate patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of povidone-iodine rinse and chlorhexidine rinse for patients undergoing dental implant treatments, as well as their bacteriostatic efficacy. Patients needing implant or bone augmentation surgery were randomized into two groups: povidone-iodine(PVP-I) and chlorhexidine(CHX). On the first day after surgery, pain levels were assessed by Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) to compare the two mouthwashes. At two weeks post-surgery, wound healing was evaluated using the early wound healing index. Finally, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were employed to compare each mouthwash's flavor, texture, and whether it caused irritation or mucosal staining. The significance of intergroup differences was tested using both an intention to treat and a per-protocol analysis. A total of 83 patients(with a median age of 43, 49 females) were enrolled and randomized. In general, both rinses were similarly favorable in terms of patient comfort. Notably, the postoperative pain NRS was significantly lower in the PVP-I group (1.68 ± 0.82) than in the control group (2.55 ± 1.38, p < 0.01). Regarding to wound healing, there was no significant difference in the Early Healing Index (EHI) between the two groups (Z = 0.351, p = 0.725). Regarding PROMs, at day 7, the swelling reduction was significantly greater in the PVP-I group (p = 0.031). Additionally, fewer participants in the PVP-I group (7%) reported mucosal irritation compared to the CHX group (29%) (p < 0.05), while other PROMs showed no significant differences in both groups. Within the scope of this trial, PVP-I rinse demonstrated superior patient comfort (significantly lower postoperative pain intensity, less mucosal irritation, and greater swelling reduction at day 7) compared to CHX rinse, though both rinses showed comparable wound healing outcomes. PVP-I may serve as an alternative for dental implant therapy, but all mouthrinses should be used judiciously under clinical guidance. The study protocol was registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( www.chictr.org.cn ) under registration number ChiCTR2500098491 on 10/03/2025 (retrospectively registered).",
38084405,10.1111/jcpe.13911,A multi-centre randomized controlled trial on alveolar ridge preservation with immediate or delayed implant placement: Need for soft-tissue augmentation.,Journal of clinical periodontology,2024,"To assess the impact of the timing of implant placement following alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) on the need for soft-tissue augmentation (STA) and to identify the risk factors for horizontal and vertical soft-tissue loss. Patients with a single failing tooth in the anterior maxilla (15-25) were treated at six centres. Following tooth extraction, they were randomly allocated to the test group (immediate implant placement, IIP) or control group (delayed implant placement, DIP). ARP was performed in both groups and implants were immediately restored with an implant-supported provisional crown. Six months after tooth extraction and ARP, a panel of five blinded clinicians assessed the need for STA on the basis of anonymized clinical pictures and a digital surface model. Lack of buccal soft-tissue convexity and/or mid-facial recession qualified for STA. Pre-operative and 6-month digital surface models were superimposed to assess horizontal and vertical soft-tissue changes. Thirty patients were included per group (test: 20 females, 10 males, mean age 53.1; control: 15 females, 15 males, mean age 59.8). The panel deemed STA as necessary in 24.1% and 35.7% of the cases following IIP and DIP, respectively. The difference was not statistically significant (odds ratio [OR] = 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.54-5.84]; p = .343). Loss of buccal soft-tissue profile was higher following DIP (estimated mean ratio = 1.66; 95% CI [1.10-2.52]; p = .018), as was mid-facial recession (mean difference [MD] = 0.47 mm; 95% CI [0.12-0.83]; p = .011). Besides DIP, regression analysis identified soft-tissue thickness (-0.57; 95% CI [-1.14 to -0.01]; p = .045) and buccal bone dehiscence (0.17; 95% CI [0.01-0.34]; p = .045) as additional risk factors for mid-facial recession. Surgeons found IIP significantly more difficult than DIP (visual analogue scale MD = -34.57; 95% CI [-48.79 to -20.36]; p < .001). This multi-centre randomized controlled trial failed to demonstrate a significant difference in the need for STA between IIP and DIP when judged by a panel of blinded clinicians. Based on objective soft-tissue changes, patients with thin buccal soft tissues, with a buccal bone dehiscence and treated with a delayed approach appeared particularly prone to soft-tissue loss.",
