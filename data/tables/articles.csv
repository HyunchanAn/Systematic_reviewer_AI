Directional texture analysis via Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) offsets was employed to assess anisotropic bone remodeling patterns. This randomized clinical trial included 32 adults (≥ 18 years) with ≤ 5 mm residual bone height, randomized to sinus lift with allograft or xenograft. All procedures were performed by one surgeon, with CBCT-based texture analysis (Mazda software) at 6 months and subsequent implant placement. Gray-level co-occurrence matrix parameters were calculated from standardized ROIs. Insertion torque was recorded using a manual torque meter. statistical analysis compared outcomes between groups. Mean insertion torque was higher in the allograft group (45.2 ± 6.8 N·cm) than the xenograft group (32.1 ± 5.3 N·cm; P < 0.001). Allografts showed greater structural uniformity (higher Angular Second Moment and pixel correlation), while xenografts exhibited higher entropy, sum entropy, and contrast (P < 0.001). Directional GLCM offsets revealed anisotropic remodeling patterns: allografts displayed organized vertical alignment, xenografts horizontal variation and multidirectional irregularity. Allografts provide higher insertion torque and improved initial stability by creating a dense and uniform structure, while xenografts show longer-term adaptation to the host bone due to their structural complexity. Directional differences in tissue parameters introduce anisotropy as an indicator of bone maturity, highlighting the need to personalize surgical protocols based on graft material characteristics and radiological patterns.",
40919764,,Does it take more than a static pilot guide to match the accuracy of dynamic navigation? A preliminary randomised study.,"International journal of oral implantology (Berlin, Germany)",2025,"To compare the accuracy of static guided surgery using a pilot drill guide and dynamic guided surgery for dental implant placement. Partially edentulous adult patients requiring implant placement were randomly assigned to either the static guided surgery group using a pilot drill guide or the dynamic guided surgery group. Digital implant planning was conducted using intraoral scans and CBCT with planning software to determine the optimal prosthetic position. Postoperative CBCT scans were taken to compare with the plan and assess platform, apex, vertical and angular deviations from the planned implant positions. A total of 25 implants were placed. Mean deviations at the implant platform were 1.17 ± 0.75 mm for the static guided surgery group and 1.17 ± 0.71 mm for the dynamic guided surgery group, with no significant differences (P = 0.983). Apical deviations were 2.39 ± 1.22 mm for the static guided surgery group and 1.75 ± 0.59 mm for the dynamic guided surgery group, with no significant differences (P = 0.112). Vertical deviations were 0.79 ± 0.50 mm for the static guided surgery group and 0.61 ± 0.51 mm for the dynamic guided surgery group (P = 0.403). Significant differences were found in angular deviations, with the static guided surgery group showing 10.9 ± 5.63 degrees and the dynamic guided surgery group showing 4.72 ± 2.63 degrees (P = 0.002). Independent variables such as sex, age, implant location, arch and implant size did not significantly influence accuracy. Both static and dynamic guided surgery offer comparable precision in implant placement, with dynamic guided surgery providing superior angular accuracy. Further studies with larger sample sizes are recommended to validate these findings. The authors declare there are no conflicts of interest relating to this study.",
40866867,10.1186/s12903-025-06366-8,The impact of mixed reality training method on novice trainees of dental implants: an in vitro study.,BMC oral health,2025,"A novel dental implant training method based on mixed reality (MR) navigation technology was developed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the learning effect of this method in novices. We designed and developed an MR-based training method that provides real-time supervision, teaching, and guidance. Thirty novices who had passed a baseline test and had no prior experience with implant surgery were randomly divided into two groups: the MR Group (n = 15) was trained using the MR training method, while the traditional group (n = 15) received training using conventional methods. Each group involved the following steps: (I) pretest; (II) immediate post-test; (III) dental implant training and (IV) retention test. Implant deviations, including platform points, middle points, apex points and axial angles, were measured. Subsequently, learning curves were analyzed, and the usability of the system was evaluated using the System Usability Scale (SUS). After training with both methods, the implantation deviations in both groups were significantly reduced compared with the pretest (P < 0.001). Except for the axial angle deviation in the immediate post-test, all deviations in the MR group on the immediate post-test and retention test were significantly lower than those in the traditional group (P < 0.05). The learning curve results showed that the learning time and learning effect of the MR group (Y = -95.62X + 1499) during the training process were better than those of the traditional group (Y = -77.36X + 1367). The MR group (80.83 ± 4.88) had significantly greater SUS scores than did the traditional group (69.50 ± 5.36) (P < 0.0001). This MR-training method demonstrates excellent usability and can significantly improve the implantation learning outcomes for novices. Compared to traditional methods, it exhibits better immediate and retention learning effects. This approach offers a novel perspective and strategy for developing personalized and efficient implant placement teaching methods.",

40692347,10.1111/cid.70076,Chairside vs Prefabricated Sealing Socket Abutments for Posterior Immediate Implants: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,Clinical implant dentistry and related research,2025,"This randomized clinical trial aimed to compare changes in soft tissue height, probing depth, and buccal contour volume loss following immediate implant placement using either chairside composite or prefabricated zirconia Sealing Socket Abutments (SSAs) in the posterior region. 47 patients requiring posterior tooth extraction and immediate implant placement were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the composite Sealing Socket Abutment (CS) group (n = 24), receiving chairside-fabricated abutments, or the zirconia Sealing Socket Abutment (ZR) group (n = 23), receiving prefabricated abutments. Implants were placed immediately after extraction, using static computer-assisted implant surgery (sCAIS). Supra-Platform Tissue Height (SPTH) and total horizontal tissues (THT) were assessed using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) over a 3-month healing period. Implant survival, probing pocket depths (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP) and plaque index (PI) were recorded clinically, while volumetric analysis was performed using digital impressions. SPTH remained stable from baseline to the 3-month follow-up, with a mean change of -0.17 mm in the CS group and -0.44 mm in the ZR group. These differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). THT exhibited significant horizontal shrinkage in both groups over the 3-month period. In the CS group, THT decreased by 1.00 mm, while the ZR group showed a reduction of 1.17 mm (p < 0.001). PPD increased in the CS group from 2.8 mm to 3.7 mm on the palatal/lingual aspect and from 2.5 mm to 3.2 mm on the buccal aspect (p = 0.026). In contrast, the ZR group showed a decrease from 3.1 mm to 2.7 mm palatally/lingually and remained stable buccally at 2.6 mm to 2.7 mm (p = 0.001). BOP in the CS group decreased from 42.3% to 7.7% (p = 0.009), while the ZR group maintained low BOP levels, decreasing slightly from 17.4% to 4.4% (p = 0.346). Both approaches showed comparable outcomes. ZR abutments resulted in shallower probing depths, while CS abutments showed less volumetric shrinkage. SPTH remained stable in both groups. This trial was registered prior to patient enrollment at ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05748379.",
40360023,10.1016/j.jdent.2025.105814,Accuracy of two static computer-assisted implant surgery systems in partially edentulous patients: A randomized clinical trial using intraoral scan data.,Journal of dentistry,2025,"To compare implant deviations between two static computer-assisted implant surgery (sCAIS) systems in partially edentulous patients using intraoral scan data. Fully guided dental implant placements were planned using two implant systems, Straumann Bone Level Tapered (S-BLT) and CAMLOG SCREW LINE Promote plus (C-SL), with respective planning software (S-BLT: coDiagnostiX; C-SL: SMOP). Intraoperative scans were performed after implant placement and compared to virtual implant positions in Geomagic Control X (GCX) a software for three-dimensional (3D) quality control. Deviations were analyzed in a coordinate system (x-, y-, z-axis) and total deviations (entry point, apex, and angular deviations) were compared. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.0125. Sixty-nine patients received 80 implants placed by 13 surgeons with varying experience in sCAIS. Deviations from 75 datasets were evaluated. Mean 3D deviation at the entry point was 0.64 ± 0.25 mm for S-BLT and 0.75 ± 0.33 mm for C-SL. At the apex, the mean 3D deviation was 1.00 ± 0.40 mm for S-BLT and 1.26 ± 0.68 mm for C-SL. The mean angular deviation was 3.22 ± 2.12° for S-BLT and 3.80 ± 2.81° for C-SL. No significant differences were observed between systems, surgeon experience or implant location (all p > 0.0125). Both the drill-body guided (C-SL) and drill-handle guided (S-BLT) systems provide comparable and predictable outcomes in fully guided implant placements. No system or planning software was found to be superior. sCAIS ensures predictable results in terms of accuracy in implant positioning, compensating for varying levels of surgical experience.",
40298001,10.1111/jcpe.14174,A Multi-Centre Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing dPTFE Membrane to Collagen Membrane in Lateral Bone Augmentation at Single Sites in the Anterior Maxilla: 1-Year Results.,Journal of clinical periodontology,2025,"To compare a dense polytetrafluoroethylene (dPTFE) membrane with a collagen membrane in guided bone regeneration for lateral bone augmentation at single sites in the anterior maxilla in terms of alveolar width, height, complications, need for additional therapy and implant outcomes. Patients with a class 4 defect at a single site in the anterior maxilla (15-25) were recruited at five centres. Following flap elevation and conditioning of the recipient site, they were randomly allocated to the dPTFE membrane group or the collagen membrane group. Nine months following bone augmentation, re-entry was performed and implants were placed. Alveolar dimensions were assessed on superimposed cone-beam computed tomography images taken prior to surgery, immediately post operation and at 9 months. Implant outcomes were registered 1 year after bone augmentation. Thirty-six patients were randomised (dPTFE membrane group: 8 females, 10 males, mean age 39; collagen membrane group: 14 females, 4 males, mean age 51) and all complied until the 1-year follow-up. At 9 months, the estimated marginal mean alveolar width was not significantly different between the groups (estimated marginal mean difference at 3 mm below the crest: 0.65 mm; 95% CI: -0.82 to 2.12; p = 0.381). Infection occurred in 6/18 patients treated with a dPTFE membrane and in 0/18 patients treated with a collagen membrane (p = 0.019). Infection occurred in every centre and had a negative impact on the alveolar width at 9 months, despite taking anti-infective measures in every patient and additional bone augmentation in two patients. Implants could be installed in a prosthetically driven position, integrated uneventfully and yielded minimal marginal bone loss. dPTFE membrane and collagen membrane are both effective in lateral bone augmentation. However, dPTFE membrane is more prone to infection than collagen membrane, thereby increasing the need for additional therapy. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05426616.",
40702480,10.1186/s12903-025-06560-8,Patient-reported outcome measures comparing povidone iodine rinse and chlorhexidine rinse for dental implant therapy: a randomized controlled trial.,BMC oral health,2025,"To evaluate patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of povidone-iodine rinse and chlorhexidine rinse for patients undergoing dental implant treatments, as well as their bacteriostatic efficacy. Patients needing implant or bone augmentation surgery were randomized into two groups: povidone-iodine(PVP-I) and chlorhexidine(CHX). On the first day after surgery, pain levels were assessed by Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) to compare the two mouthwashes. At two weeks post-surgery, wound healing was evaluated using the early wound healing index. Finally, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were employed to compare each mouthwash's flavor, texture, and whether it caused irritation or mucosal staining. The significance of intergroup differences was tested using both an intention to treat and a per-protocol analysis. A total of 83 patients(with a median age of 43, 49 females) were enrolled and randomized. In general, both rinses were similarly favorable in terms of patient comfort. Notably, the postoperative pain NRS was significantly lower in the PVP-I group (1.68 ± 0.82) than in the control group (2.55 ± 1.38, p < 0.01). Regarding to wound healing, there was no significant difference in the Early Healing Index (EHI) between the two groups (Z = 0.351, p = 0.725). Regarding PROMs, at day 7, the swelling reduction was significantly greater in the PVP-I group (p = 0.031). Additionally, fewer participants in the PVP-I group (7%) reported mucosal irritation compared to the CHX group (29%) (p < 0.05), while other PROMs showed no significant differences in both groups. Within the scope of this trial, PVP-I rinse demonstrated superior patient comfort (significantly lower postoperative pain intensity, less mucosal irritation, and greater swelling reduction at day 7) compared to CHX rinse, though both rinses showed comparable wound healing outcomes. PVP-I may serve as an alternative for dental implant therapy, but all mouthrinses should be used judiciously under clinical guidance.

40604796,10.1186/s12903-025-05529-x,Investigation of the expression of the C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTXI) in saliva during early and delayed loading of dental implants.,BMC oral health,2025,"Implants are commonly used as a treatment choice for partially dentate or edentulous patients. Currently, no specific biomarker for assessing the bone status around dental implants of healthy patients has been reported for evaluating bone deposition, resorption, or stability. CTXI (C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) is a known specific biomarker for bone resorption. However, CTXI levels in the saliva of healthy patients with dental implants have not been investigated. This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate salivary CTXI levels in dental implant patients with early and delayed loading and to compare them with the values of the periotest to determine implant stability and loading time. This study was conducted in Karachi, Pakistan, and included 40 patients with dental implants placed in the posterior mandible. Patients were randomly divided into two groups based on the timing of implant loading: an early loading group, where implants were functionally loaded within 1 month of placement, and a delayed loading group, where implants were loaded after 3 months. The intervention involved functional loading of the implants according to the assigned group. Implant stability was assessed using a periotest on the day of surgery and at 1 month or 3 months, depending on the group. Additionally, saliva samples were collected from all patients at 1 month and 3 months to evaluate CTXI expression levels using sandwich ELISA. A comparison by periotest showed that dental implants were stable in the early loading group and that osseointegration was good; thus, loading could be applied within one month of dental implant placement. However, in our study, the CTXI bone turnover marker was not detected in any group and thus cannot be used to indicate bone implant stability or loading time. This study demonstrates that early loading of dental implants can achieve stability and osseointegration within one month, as confirmed by Periotest measurements. However, salivary CTXI levels were undetectable in both early and delayed loading groups, indicating that this biomarker is unsuitable for assessing bone-implant stability or determining the optimal timing for implant loading in healthy patients. These findings suggest further research to explore alternative biomarkers for non-invasive osseointegration and implant stability monitoring.

Photofunctionalization(PF) with UV light is a promising method to enhance dental implant osseointegration. The study evaluates the effect of the PF on bone quality around the implants using Fractal Dimension Analysis (FDA). A total of 42 implants were placed in a split-mouth design and evaluated using FDA on panoramic radiographs taken pre- and post-operatively. Regions of interest (25 × 25 pixels) were analyzed using ImageJ. Statistical analysis used SPSS 26 with a 95% confidence level. Shapiro-Wilk test confirmed non-normal distribution. A statistically significant increase in Fractal dimension(FD) values was observed in the test group between pre- and post-operative images (p = 0.044). The control group showed a non-significant increase (p = 0.794). PF appears to enhance osseointegration by improving bone microstructure as shown by increased FD values. FDA is a reliable imaging-based proxy for evaluating implant-related bone changes.

One hundred patients needing dental replacement were randomly assigned (1:1) to either a multimedia group (n = 50) or a verbal group (n = 50). They completed self-administered questionnaires covering demographics, confidence with their awareness level, knowledge (score 0-5), anxiety (score 5-25) and decision-making before and after receiving either a multimedia or verbal explanation of implant surgery. Knowledge scores increased significantly in both groups (p < 0.001), rising from 1.96 to 3.90 in the multimedia group and from 2.00 to 3.98 in the verbal group. Anxiety levels also declined markedly over time (p < 0.001), dropping from 12.76 to 11.48 (multimedia) and from 13.92 to 12.16 (verbal). Neither the group effect nor the interaction effect was significant. No significant difference in decision change was observed in either the multimedia (p = 0.289) or verbal (p = 0.146) groups. Most patients in both groups relied on their dentist's recommendation regarding whether to proceed with freehand or CAIS, even after receiving the interventions. Meanwhile, cost remained a significant barrier to proceeding with implant therapy in both groups. Both multimedia and verbal interventions significantly improved patient knowledge and reduced anxiety, although the magnitude of anxiety reduction was modest. Changes in decision-making were limited and largely influenced by cost and the dentist's recommendation. Given this single-centre design and modest sample size, caution is advised when generalising these findings.",

This two-centre, two-arm randomized clinical trial investigated 69 subjects: 34 in the particulate group and 35 in the collagenated group. Patients were randomly assigned to receive single implant placement with simultaneous guided bone regeneration (GBR) using either particulate deproteinized porcine bone material (DPBM) or cross-linked collagenated DPBM. Quantitative evaluations were conducted for horizontal width, augmented area, and augmented volume in both hard and soft tissue dimensions. Immediately after surgery, the collagenated group exhibited higher hard tissue dimensions in terms of horizontal width and augmented area. After 4 months, the difference between the two groups decreased to a non-significant level, mainly attributable to the high shrinkage rate of the collagenated group (32.32 [20.79] %) compared to the particulate group (19.90 [14.33] %). No significant difference was observed regarding the soft tissue contour analyses between the two groups after 4 months. There were no significant differences between cross-linked collagenated and particulated DPBMs regarding the dimensional outcomes of horizontal augmentation with the retentive-flap technique. The high resorption rate of the collagenated bone substitute negates its initial superiority in both radiographic and soft tissue dimensions (no. KCT0005348).",
40544298,10.1186/s12903-025-06360-0,Peri-implant bone behavior after single drilling technique versus undersized drilling technique of immediately loaded implant in posterior maxilla: a one-year prospective study.,BMC oral health,2025,"Implant placement in the posterior maxilla is challenging, so modifications of the surgical techniques were introduced to overcome these challenges. The undersized drilling technique uses a final drill smaller than the diameter of the implant. The single drilling technique is a simplified method where the osteotomy is made using a single drill without sequential widening. This study was directed to evaluate the peri-implant bone behavior of the undersized drilling technique versus the single drilling technique of immediately loaded dental implants inserted in the posterior maxilla. 32 patients were selected for prosthetic replacement of a missing maxillary posterior single tooth by an immediately loaded dental implant and divided randomly into two equal groups. In Group I: 16 patients received 16 implants using the undersized drilling technique, while in Group II: 16 patients received 16 implants using the single drilling technique. Insertion torque, implant stability, modified sulcus bleeding index (mBI), peri-implant probing depth, bone density, and marginal bone height were evaluated for both groups. Statistical analysis was made for clinical and radiographic data. 32 implants were inserted in the posterior maxilla. During a 12-month follow-up, every dental implant was successful with no complications. Both techniques showed high insertion torque (≥ 35 Ncm) and primary stability (> 70 ISQ) with no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Also, there were no significant differences between the study groups regarding peri-implant soft tissue health, bone density, and marginal bone loss (P > 0.05). Both techniques revealed comparable, promising clinical and radiographic outcomes over a 12-month post-loading follow-up period when the immediate loading protocol was used in the posterior maxilla, where bone density is poor, but preparing the implant bed using the single drilling technique offers several merits for both the patient and clinician. In addition to avoiding excessive heat generation, mechanical damage, and high frictional forces during drilling procedures, surgical operations, and surgical site exposure take less time.

40552788,10.1111/cid.70069,A 6-Year Randomized Controlled Trial on Different Implant Designs in Maxillary Overdenture Patients.,Clinical implant dentistry and related research,2025,"In order to reduce crestal bone remodeling around the implant shoulder, different implant macrodesigns have been developed. The presence of microthreads at the coronal part of the implant, as well as platform-shifting using a conical internal abutment connection, is suggested to limit bone remodeling. However, long-term studies excluding confounding factors to confirm this are scarce. This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the effect of implant neck design (microthreaded vs. non-microthreaded) as well as type of abutment connection (internal conical vs. external flat-to-flat) on long-term crestal bone remodeling and peri-implant health. Additionally, the clinical outcome of bar-retained maxillary overdentures on 4 implants is reported after at least 6 years of function. Twenty-five patients were treated with a bar-retained maxillary overdenture. Each patient received 4 different implants, one of each of the 4 experimental designs, with respectively: internal connection and microthreads on the implant neck (I MT); internal connection without microthreads (I NMT); external connection with microthreads (E MT); and external connection without microthreads (E NMT). Other features, such as diameter, surface topography, extent of platform switch, as well as the surgical and prosthetic treatment protocol, were identical. The implants were randomly allocated to the sites (posterior right, anterior right, anterior left, and posterior left), based on a pre-randomized, fixed-order assignment generated by a randomization software. Radiographic crestal bone loss (CBL), plaque score (PS), bleeding on probing (BoP) and probing pocket depth (PPD) were determined after 1 and 6 function years. Two implants in 2 patients were excluded because of protocol deviations, requiring the placement of a wider implant. Four out of 98 implants (4.1%) failed during the provisionalization process. These were replaced with the same type of implant after 3 months of healing and were included in further analysis. Due to the relatively small sample size and high drop-out rate, the effect of microthread design and connection on implant survival could only be reported descriptively. Twenty patients could be re-evaluated at the 1-year and 6-year time points, resulting in 78 examined implants. These showed a mean CBL of 0.39 mm (SD: 0.68; range: 0-3.42) after 1 year and 0.37 mm (SD: 0.61; range: -0.34-3.03) after 6 years. Between the 4 different study implants, no statistically significant difference in CBL could be identified over time. Neither microthreads nor connection type showed a statistically significant effect on CBL over time, nor on PPD, BoP, and PS at the 6-year re-evaluation. Six years after implant placement, a four-implant, bar-retained maxillary overdenture shows a high implant and prosthetic survival rate with crestal bone stability. The presence or absence of microthreads and the type of implant-abutment connection have only a limited effect on peri-implant CBL. The peri-implant health parameters are indicative of the absence of peri-implantitis. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06821308.",

In this randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effects of antibacterial dual-light photodynamic therapy (aPDT) in peri-implant disease in reduction of inflammation in the peri-implant tissues. Forty patients with newly diagnosed peri-implant disease were recruited. The diagnoses were established clinically and by radiological bone loss (RBL). Dual-light aPDT was provided by indocyanine green mouth rinsing and 50:50, 405 nm, and 810 nm light applicator. The treatment group (n = 20) was randomized to use aPDT treatment at home for 4 weeks. The treatment was carried out once daily for 2 weeks, then twice daily for the next 2 weeks. The control group (n = 20) continued enhanced self-care during the study period. Traditional measurement methods around the implant were measured at the beginning, at 2 weeks and at 4 weeks. During the study period, VPI decreased in both groups. In the treatment group BOP decreased from mean (SD) 4.7 ± 1.3 to 1.8 ± 1.6, p < 0.0001, but no change was observed in the control group (3.5 ± 2.3 to 3.0 ± 2.3, p = 0.39).

Following a comparison of the horizontal bone gain and the histomorphometric bone area percent among both groups after 6 months of graft consolidation, 40 implants were inserted during the second surgical stage. All of the grafts were consolidated. A statistically insignificant difference was found between the control group's mean 6-month postoperative horizontal bone width of (8.10 ± 0.83) and that of the study one of (7.90 ± 0.77). The control group's mean bone gain was recorded (4.76 ± 0.81) versus (4.63 ± 0.78) for the study group, with a statistically insignificant difference. Both groups showed histological evidence of a moderate number of osteoblasts, mature trabecular bone, and lamellae encircling large fatty marrow spaces. A statistically significant difference (p = 0.021) was found between the control group's mean bone area percentage of new bone formation (38.83% ± 1.17%) and that of the study group (34.40% ± 3.71%).

Patients with single posterior edentulous spaces were randomly assigned to two groups (HPL and HPB), and implants were inserted using a guided protocol. Screw-retained provisional and metal-ceramic crowns were provided per the manufacturer's loading protocol. The implant stability quotient (ISQ) was measured immediately and after 15, 30, 45 (HPL loading), 60, 90 (HPB loading) days, and then at 15, 30, 45 days, 6 and 12 months after final loading. Bone level was assessed at baseline, and 2-weeks, 6 and 12 months after loading. Generalized Estimating Equations regression was used for data analysis due to dependent longitudinal measurements and pooled data from multiple implants within patients. Thirty-two patients received 48 implants (HPL=22; HPB=26). The initial Mean ISQ was 65.4±10.7Ncm (HPL=63.3±10.4; HPB=67.4±10.7; p=0.191). There was an increase in ISQ in the short-term post-insertion period from T0 to T3 (45 days) in both groups, and no significant changes occurred until T2 (30 days). ISQ comparisons between the final restoration and 1-year follow-up showed significant improvement for HPB (p=0.007) and HPL (p=0.045) groups. The final regression model confirmed that ISQ measures were affected by the progression of time after insertion until 60 days (p=0.003), 180 days (p<0.001), and 1-year (p<0.001). HPB group showed higher ISQ at any time (p=0.048). There was a progressive increase in secondary stability up to approximately 60 days, and the hydrophobic group showed slightly higher ISQ measurements at all time points. This study provides evidence on the comparative longitudinal performance of implants with hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces in the posterior region, showing a progressive increase in the secondary stability up to approximately 60 days in both groups. The hydrophobic surface group showed slightly higher ISQ measurements at all time points, however, with no relevant clinical impact on survival and marginal bone changes.",

The present study was a randomized clinical trial with a split mouth design. Surgical sites were split randomly into two groups: Group 1 (30 implants) had a topical application of platelet-rich fibrin at the site of implant osteotomy, while Group 2 (30 implants) did not have any platelet-rich fibrin application. Marginal bone level (MBL), peri-implant bone density (BD), wound healing index (WHI), and peri-implant sulcus probing depth (PD) were assessed. For BD, intergroup comparison was done using t-test and intragroup comparison was done using paired t-test. For MBL, PD, and WHI, intergroup comparison was done using Mann-Whitney U test, and intragroup comparison was done using Wilcoxon Signed rank test. From baseline to 12 months, a highly significant difference (p < 0.01) was seen for change in peri-implant bone density, with Group 1 showing greater values. Intergroup comparison of MBL and change in MBL showed values with highly significant differences (p < 0.01), with more bone loss in Group 2. Probing depth values showed significant differences with lesser values in Group 1. Wound healing index values were lower and highly significant in Group 1. Application of platelet-rich fibrin at the osteotomy site is associated with a decline in probing depth and wound healing index, and a rise in peri-implant bone density with minimal MBL.",

The teeth were minimally and traumatically extracted. CBCT images were obtained 2 (T0) and 120 (T1) days after extraction. The buccal bone wall height, palatal bone wall height, and alveolar area were compared between both groups, as well as the volumetric contraction through overlapped images (T1 - T0) using Mimics software. The data were compared using the Mann-Whitney test (P .05). The intragroup evaluation showed a significant buccal and palatal crest height resorption in the control group (P .05). In the intergroup assessment, the test group was superior to the control group in maintaining the average alveolar ridge area since the control group showed an area loss of approximately 39% between T0 and T1, whereas this reduction was approximately 15% in the test group (P .05). It is possible to conclude that using rhBMP-2 after tooth extraction resulted in better socket preservation, maintaining 2.5 times greater bone availability in the alveolar ridge than that of the control group.",

The current randomized clinical trial included 20 patients with inadequate KMW and requiring placement of dental implant. The participants were randomly distributed into two groups. Group 1 received FGG 2 months before placing the dental implant while group 2 received the FGG at the second stage of implant surgery. The following parameters were evaluated and statistically analyzed at baseline, day 7, as well as 1, 3, 6, and 9 months postoperatively, KMW, STT and shrinkage percentage of the FGG. Twenty patients with ages ranging from 30 to 55 years with reduced KMW were included in the current study. Both groups showed a significant increase in KMW and STT on day7, 1, 3, 6, and 9 months postoperatively while the intergroup comparison showed no significant differences in KWM, STT, and shrinkage percentage between both groups at the same point of time. The two study groups' outcomes demonstrated that the FGG can be placed either before or after dental implants to improve the soft tissue augmentation surrounding the implants. However, the implantologist should take patient preferences and long-term stability into consideration.",
40335732,10.1007/s00784-025-06364-8,Influence of intermediate abutment height and timing of placement on marginal bone loss in single implant-supported crowns: a 12-month follow-up randomized clinical trial.,Clinical oral investigations,2025,"To determine the most effective combination of abutment height and timing of placement in reducing marginal bone loss (MBL). 54 patients received at least one single screw-retained crown on an implant replacing a posterior tooth (60 implants). Implants were divided into six groups based on intermediate abutment height (1.5 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm) and timing of placement (immediate: surgery 1; delayed: surgery 2): Group A3I (height 3, surgery 1), Group A2I (height 2, surgery 1), Group A15I (height 1.5, surgery 1), Group A3D (height 3, surgery 2), Group A2D (height 2, surgery 2), Group A15D (height 1.5, surgery 2). Mesial and distal linear radiographic measurements were taken at five follow-up points: implant surgery, crown placement (T1), and 3 (T2), 6 (T3), and 12 months after loading (T4). Partial and total MBL were compared between groups. After 12 months, the lowest MBL was found in groups A3I (0.13 ± 0.11 mm) and A2I (0.24 ± 0.11 mm), with no statistical difference between them. Groups A15I (0.70 ± 0.12 mm), A3D (0.66 ± 0.11 mm), A2D (0.62 ± 0.12 mm), and A15D (0.78 ± 0.11 mm) showed significantly higher MBL than groups 1 and 2, with no statistical difference among them. Immediate abutments of 2-3 mm resulted in lower MBL compared to 1.5 mm immediate abutments or any delayed abutments.

Patients requiring single-tooth implant restorations were recruited and randomized into two groups: robotic-assisted surgery and freehand implant surgery. The accuracy of implant positioning was compared by assessing immediate postoperative CBCT scans against preoperative planning software. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded, and data were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. The time required for implant placement in each group was documented. A 6-month follow-up measured the implant survival rates. The study included 24 patients (median age 36, 18 female). In the robotic-assisted surgery group, the average platform global deviation, apex global deviation, and angular deviation were 0.70 ± 0.11 mm, 0.70 ± 0.12 mm, and 1.09° ± 0.67°, respectively. In the freehand implant surgery group, these measures were 1.24 ± 0.59 mm, 2.13 ± 1.26 mm, and 7.43° ± 6.12°, respectively, with statistically significant differences. Regarding the duration of surgery, the robotic-assisted surgery group required 18.8 ± 4.89 min. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were similar across both groups, and the implant survival rate was 100% in both groups at the 6-month follow-up. This study found that robot-assisted implant placement offers higher accuracy in implant positioning compared to freehand placement, while requiring longer operation times. Future developments should focus on simplifying the registration and design of robot systems to enhance efficiency and facilitate their broader clinical adoption.",
39185638,10.1002/JPER.24-0250,Histological and immunohistochemical soft-tissue response to cylindrical and concave abutments: Multicenter randomized clinical trial.,Journal of periodontology,2025,"This study aimed to analyze the influence of concave and cylindrical abutments on peri-implant soft tissue. Dimensions, collagen fiber orientation, and immunohistochemical data were assessed. A multicenter, split-mouth, double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted. Two groups were analyzed: cylindrical abutments and concave abutments. After a 12-week healing period, peri-implant soft tissue samples were collected, processed, and evaluated for dimensions, collagen fiber orientation, and immunohistochemical data. Inflammatory infiltration and vascularization were assessed, and the abutment surfaces were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. The statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 20.0 statistical package. A total of 74 samples in 37 patients were evaluated. Histological evaluation of peri-implant soft tissue dimensions revealed significant differences between concave and cylindrical abutments. Concave abutments exhibited greater total height (concave: 3.57 ± 0.28 - cylindrical: 2.95 ± 0.27) and barrier epithelium extension (concave: 2.46 ± 0.17 - cylindrical: 1.89 ± 0.21) (p < 0.05), while the supracrestal connective tissue extension (concave: 1.11 ± 0.17 - cylindrical: 1.03 ± 0.16) was slightly greater (p > 0.05). Collagen fiber orientation favored concave abutments (23.76 ± 5.86), with significantly more transverse/perpendicular fibers than for cylindrical abutments (15.68 ± 4.57). The immunohistochemical analysis evidenced greater inflammatory and vascular intensity in the lower portion for both abutments, though concave abutments showed lower overall intensity (concave: 1.05 ± 0.78 - cylindrical: 1.97 ± 0.68) (p < 0.05). The abutment surface analysis demonstrated a higher percentage of tissue remnants on concave abutments (42.47 ± 1.32; 45.12 ± 3.03) (p < 0.05). Within the limitations of this study, concave abutments presented significantly greater peri-implant tissue height, linked to an extended barrier epithelium, versus cylindrical abutments in thick tissue phenotype. This enhanced soft tissue sealing, favoring a greater percentage of transversely oriented collagen fibers. The concave design reduced chronic inflammatory exudation with T and B cells, thus minimizing the risk of chronic inflammation. This study looked at how 2 different shapes of dental implant abutments (the parts that connect the implant to the crown), specifically concave and cylindrical, affect the soft tissue around the implants. We wanted to see how these shapes influenced the tissue's size, structure, and health. We conducted a clinical trial with 37 patients, comparing the 2 types of abutments in the same mouth over 12 weeks. Our findings showed that the concave abutments led to a taller and more extensive layer of protective tissue around the implant compared to the cylindrical ones. This protective tissue had more favorable collagen fiber orientation, which is important for the strength and health of the tissue. Additionally, the concave abutments resulted in less inflammation and better tissue integration. In conclusion, concave abutments may provide better support and health for the soft tissue around dental implants, reducing the risk of chronic inflammation and potentially leading to better long-term outcomes for patients with dental implants.",

This explorative evaluation of a 3-year randomized controlled trial on strategic min-implants (MI) aims to estimate the stability changes of the remaining teeth and the tooth survival rates under different MI loading conditions. Partially edentulous study participants of a university clinic and three private practices with inadequately supported RPDs received strategic MIs (diameter 1.8-2.4 mm). According to the randomization the MIs were either immediately loaded in group A or delayed loaded in group B. The longitudinal changes of Periotest values (PTV) for teeth were compared between groups using mixed models adjusted by sex, age, jaw, tooth site, center, and baseline PTVs. The tooth survival was estimated with Kaplan-Meier analyses and group differences were analyzed using Cox regression. Altogether 232 MIs were placed under 48 mandibular and 31 maxillary RPDs with a total of 255 remaining teeth in both jaws. The initial median PTV of 9.5 in group A and 8.0 in group B decreased to 5.0 in group A and 2.0 in group B at the 3-year follow-up. In the fully adjusted model the tooth mobility reduction revealed 5.3 PTV units (95% CI: 3.5-7.2) in group A and 7.6 PTV units (95% CI: 5.4-9.9) in group B without inferiority of any group (P = 0.122). The 3-year tooth survival rates were 88% in group A versus 92% in group B without relevant group differences (P = 0.338). Strategic MIs under existing RPDs in persons with severe reduced dentitions decreased the mobility of the remaining teeth independent from implant loading modus. Further tooth loss can emerge despite of relieving the remaining dentition by the MIs. Mini-implants as supplementary abutments can restabilize loose teeth in jaws with RPDs and unfavorable tooth distributions.

However, direct comparisons of their effects on peri-implant marginal bone preservation and soft tissue healing remain limited. This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of LIPUS and LLLT on peri-implant marginal bone preservation, soft tissue healing, pain levels, and oral health-related quality of life following dental implant placement. This single-blind, randomized controlled trial included 63 patients undergoing maxillary or mandibular implant placement, randomly allocated to LIPUS (n = 21), LLLT (n = 21), or control (n = 21) groups. LIPUS was applied twice weekly for 4 weeks, while LLLT was administered in 4 sessions over 2 weeks post-implant. Marginal bone loss (MBL) and OHRQoL (OHIP-14) were assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks. Soft tissue healing (Landry Healing Index) and pain (VAS) were evaluated at baseline, 7-, 14-, 21-, and 30-days post-implant. LIPUS significantly reduced marginal bone loss at 6 weeks and 3 months post-implant compared to LLLT and control groups (p < 0.05). LLLT demonstrated superior soft tissue healing at 7-, 14-, 21-, and 30-days post-implant (p < 0.05). Both interventions significantly decreased pain intensity and improved OHRQoL at various time points compared to the control group (p < 0.05). LIPUS and LLLT significantly enhance peri-implant marginal bone preservation, soft tissue healing, pain management, and OHRQoL in dental implant patients compared to standard care. LIPUS was more effective for peri-implant marginal bone preservation, while LLLT excelled in soft tissue healing. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05938868) on July 11, 2023.",

In 27 patients with a single tooth gap in the anterior region (second premolar to second premolar in the maxilla) a dental implant was placed. Following implant placement GBR was performed at the buccal aspect using randomly either a resorbable collagen membrane (RES) or a non-resorbable titanium-reinforced ePTFE membrane (N-RES). Radiographic (cone-beam computed tomography; CBCT) measurements were performed to assess the buccal bone thickness immediately after the implant placement with simultaneous GBR (baseline) and 6 months later. Buccal soft tissue thickness was assessed by superimposing surface scans taken at baseline and again 6 months later. A total of 25 datasets could be assessed for the bone dimensions (n = 12, RES; n = 13, N-RES) and 14 datasets for profilometric changes (n = 7, RES; n = 7, N-RES). Group RES showed a significant mean reduction in buccal bone between baseline and 6 months of 0.8 ± 0.4 mm (p = 0.004). The respective mean reduction for group N-RES amounted to 0.1 ± 0.4 mm (p = 0.581). When comparing the buccal bone changes between both group over time, group RES exhibited greater reduction in comparison to group N-RES (intergroup p = 0.017). Profilometric analyses showed a non-significant trend towards soft tissue gain in group RES 0.6 ± 0.7 mm (p = 0.125). Conversely, N-RES group revealed stability, with a mean change of 0.0 ± 0.3 mm (p = 1.000). GBR using non-resorbable membranes seems to provide greater dimensional stability of augmented bone at 6 months re-entry and before implant loading compared to resorbable membranes. The lack of differences in the profilometric outcomes and contour changes may be explained by a partial compensation through an increase in soft tissue thickness with resorbable membranes. GBR using non-resorbable membranes may offer greater dimensional stability of augmented bone compared to resorbable membranes. However, these potential benefits may be offset by a compensatory increase in soft tissue thickness when using resorbable membranes.",

A total of 120 subjects (127 implants) affected by peri-implantitis were followed over 3 years in a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Participants had been randomized to either control (access flap surgery) or test group (access flap surgery and bone substitute material). Clinical, radiographic, and patient-reported outcomes were assessed. The primary outcome was a composite measure including probing pocket depth ≤ 5 mm, absence of bleeding and suppuration on probing, soft tissue recession ≤ 1 mm, and implant neither reoperated nor lost. In an additional outcome (disease resolution), we allowed for one bleeding site and did not consider recession. While 14 implants (11%) were lost and a second surgical intervention had been performed at 3 implants (2.4%), pronounced improvements of clinical parameters were noted at remaining implants in both treatment groups at the 3-year follow-up. This was illustrated by a 3.2-3.5 mm reduction in probing pocket depth and a marginal bone level gain of 1.1-1.3 mm. The primary composite outcome, however, was only achieved at 14% of implants. The second composite outcome defining disease resolution was accomplished at 39% of implants. Patient-reported outcomes were generally favorable. At 3 years, the use of a bone substitute material in the surgical therapy of peri-implantitis did not result in a clear benefit over access flap surgery alone.

The aim of this study was to explore the influence of three materials commonly used in implant dentistry, namely titanium (Ti), dental adhesive resin (Re) and polyetheretherketone (PEEK), on the peri-implant soft tissues. In this clinical randomised comparative study, 37 bone-level implants were placed, and experimental transmucosal healing abutments made of different materials were randomly assigned to each implant. These abutments were removed together with the surrounding soft tissues after 8 weeks. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to determine the presence and localisation of different immune cells. In addition, clinical and radiographic data were collected and peri-implant bone remodeling was assessed. Compared to the Ti and PEEK groups, Re abutments revealed a higher infiltration of macrophages in the connective tissue (p = 0.04) and neutrophils in the adjacent epithelium (p = 0.03). In the Re abutments, peri-implant bone remodeling was higher compared to the other groups (p = 0.01). The use of resin material as a transmucosal healing abutment should be carefully considered as it was associated with a higher presence of inflammatory cells at 8 weeks post-implantation as well as superior bone remodeling compared to PEEK and Ti.",

Overall implant survival and restoration rates between master impression and 12 months were 100% and 98.2%, respectively. Although a trend for coronal migration of the buccal mucosa zenith, gain in mucosal thickness, and increased probing depth and bleeding on probing was observed in both groups, these changes were clinically negligible, and no substantial differences were observed between study groups regardless of variations in transmucosal abutment morphology.

Twenty-eight subjects with single dental implants exhibiting a soft tissue dehiscence were included and randomly treated with CTG, either with coronally advanced flap (CAF) or with tunnel technique (TUN). Peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) was collected at the midfacial and midlingual aspect of the implant sites at baseline and at 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90 days after the surgical intervention. The expression of angiogenin (ANG), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was investigated over a period of 3 months. Patient-reported outcomes, clinical measurements, and ultrasonography scans at multiple time points were also evaluated. The longitudinal regression revealed a significant difference in the expression of VEGF and TIMP-2 between CAF- and TUN-treated sites over 3 months (p = .033 and p = .004, respectively), whereas no significant differences were observed for ANG, FGF-2 and PDGF between the two groups. At 7 days, a direct correlation was observed between ANG levels and ultrasonographic color velocity in the CAF group (p < .001) and between ANG levels and ultrasonographic color power in the TUN group (p = .028). VEGF levels and ultrasonographic mean perfused area of the CTG were significantly correlated at the 7-day time point (p < .001 for both CAF and TUN). The expression of VEGF at 7 days was directly associated with mucosal thickness gain at 1 year (p < .001 for both groups). Early TIMP-2 expression showed an inverse correlation with time to recovery (p = .002). TIMP-2 levels at 3 months exhibited inverse correlations with mean dehiscence coverage (p = .004) and the rate of complete dehiscence coverage (p = .012). PICF biomarkers can be used to monitor early wound healing events following soft tissue grafting at implant sites. VEGF and TIMP-2 showed correlations with the 1-year clinical and volumetric outcomes, as well as with post-operative patient-reported outcomes and Doppler Ultrasonographic tissue perfusion-related parameters.",
38788137,10.11607/jomi.10943,Morphometric Comparison of Two Implants with Different Macrogeometries Placed Immediately in the Anterior Maxilla-A Randomized Clinical Trial with up to 6 Months of Follow-up.,The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants,2025,"To compare the morphometric results of immediate implants with a cylindrical (conventional) or triangular neck placed in Type 1C sockets in the anterior maxilla, with 6 months of osseointegration. This prospective randomized clinical trial comprised 20 individuals randomly assigned to each group (10 triangular-neck implants and 10 cylindrical-neck implants). Consecutively, direct measurements were performed: before (T-1) and after (T0) tooth extraction, after implant placement (T1), after 1 month of submerged implant healing (T2), when placing the healing abutment (T3), after placing the definitive crown (T3c), and after 6 months of osseointegration (T4). A significant difference in the buccal cortical thickness was identified between T1 and T3 (0.49 ± 0.86 mm). Although there was a significant increase in the buccal cortical thickness in both implants, this increase was greater for the triangularneck implants (0.08 ± 0.59 mm for cylindrical vs 0.90 ± 0.91 mm for triangular). It was also observed that implants placed below the buccal bone crest (≤ -1 mm) promote less vertical buccal bone loss than implants placed ≥ -1 mm, at crest level (-0.65 ± 0.52 mm vs -1.42 ± 0.86 mm, respectively). This observation needs to be further investigated in additional studies. The triangular-neck implants showed an increase in the cortical buccal thickness compared to the cylindrical implants. However, this increase does not fully compensate the remodeling after tooth loss.",
38728147,10.11607/jomi.10947,Does Implant Placement Below the Ridge Reduce Crestal Bone Loss? A Split-Mouth Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.,The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants,2025,"To evaluate the extent of crestal bone loss (CBL) at 2, 12, 36, and 60 months in implants placed with the shoulder at the equicrestal level and 2 mm below the alveolar ridge. A split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted by selecting subjects with a Kennedy Class IV partially edentulous mandible. Two implants of equal length and diameter were inserted, one equicrestal and the other subcrestal, in the lateral incisor sites. Using Rinn centering devices, intraoral periapical radiographs were taken at implant insertion (T0) and at 2 (T1), 12 (T2), 36 (T3), and 60 months (T4). Descriptive statistics and t test were used, with P ≤ .05 considered statistically significant. Twentyfive patients were recruited, with a mean age of 65 ± 9.88 years (range: 42 to 82 years), and none dropped out. A total of 50 implants were inserted, 25 at the crestal level and 25 at the subcrestal level. At the 60-month follow-up, no implant or prosthetic failure was recorded. An average CBL of 0.81 ± 0.40 mm (range: 0.1 to 1.6 mm) was recorded in the crestal implant group, while the subcrestal implants had an average CBL of 0.87 ± 0.41 mm (range: 0.2 to 2 mm); however, the higher CBL in the subcrestal group was not statistically significant (P = .65). Comparing the mean CBL of both groups at the various follow-ups, greater crestal bone resorption was recorded in subcrestal implants between T0 and T1 (0.25 vs 0.1 mm) and between T1 and T2 (0.39 vs 0.23 mm), while in subsequent follow-ups, a greater and statistically significant (P = .01) CBL was recorded in equicrestal implants between T3 and T4 (0.05 vs 0.18 mm). Thus, over time, the extent of CBL seems to be reduced in subcrestal implants, with bone retention above the implant shoulder. Although the position of the implant shoulder relative to the crestal ridge does not affect the CBL, subcrestal placement is recommended in order to reduce the risk of exposing the rough implant surface.",
39980395,10.1111/cid.70013,A Randomized Controlled Trial on the Timing of Soft Tissue Augmentation in Immediate Implant Placement: Soft Tissue Changes and Esthetic Outcome.,Clinical implant dentistry and related research,2025,"To assess the impact of the timing of soft tissue augmentation on soft tissue changes and esthetic outcome following single immediate implant placement (IIP) in the anterior maxilla. Patients with a failing tooth and intact buccal bone wall in the anterior maxilla (15-25) were enrolled in this RCT. Following single IIP and socket grafting, they were randomly allocated to the control group (immediate soft tissue augmentation performed in the same surgical procedure-ISTA) or the test group (delayed soft tissue augmentation performed 3 months later-DSTA). Implants were placed with a surgical guide and immediately restored with an implant-supported provisional crown. Changes in soft tissue dimensions were assessed by a blinded clinician using superimposed STL files taken prior to surgery and at 1-year follow-up. The esthetic outcome was rated by a blinded clinician and the patient at 1-year follow-up. The study adhered to the STA-COSM (Soft Tissue Augmentation-Core Outcome Set and Measurements for implant dentistry trials) guidelines. Twenty patients were randomized to each group (control: 16 females, 4 males, mean age 57.6; test: 9 females, 11 males, mean age 54.2). The mean change in buccal soft tissue profile was -0.251 and 0.083 mm for ISTA and DSTA, respectively. The mean difference of -0.318 mm in favor of DSTA was not significant (95% CI: -0.860 to 0.224, p = 0.241). Median midfacial recession was -0.200 and - 0.350 mm for ISTA and DSTA, respectively. The median difference of 0.200 mm in favor of ISTA was not significant (95% CI: -0.210 to 0.700, p = 0.311). Mesial and distal papillary recession, Pink Esthetic Score and patients' esthetic satisfaction failed to demonstrate a significant difference between the groups. In patients with an intact buccal bone wall, the timing of soft tissue augmentation following IIP had no significant impact on soft tissue changes and esthetic outcome.

39823242,10.1111/cid.13437,Bioceramics for Guided Bone Regeneration: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.,Clinical implant dentistry and related research,2025,"To compare the clinical effectiveness of a novel bioceramic (BC) with a control xenograft (BO) for guided bone regeneration (GBR) performed simultaneously with implant placement. This clinical study enrolled patients with insufficient bone volume who required GBR during implant placement to increase bone width using either BC or BO. Outcome measures included a dimensional reduction in buccal bone thickness measured by cone beam computed tomography performed immediately post-surgery and at 6 months postoperatively (ΔHBBT), soft tissue healing at 14 days, 1 month, and 6 months postoperatively, and complications rates. The primary outcome was the change in buccal bone thickness around the implant. Of the total 152 patients included, 76 from each group received BC and BO treatments. The ΔHBBT in BC and BO groups were -0.276 mm (-0.432, -0.121) and -0.614 mm (-0.769, -0.459) mm, respectively, rejecting the null hypothesis. No significant difference in soft tissue healing was observed between the two groups, with no inflammatory changes in 96.05% and 90.79% of the BC and BO groups, respectively, at 2 weeks postoperatively. However, the BC group exhibited a lower overall complication rate (3.95%), including mild inflammation, poor soft tissue healing, and bone graft extrusion in 3 out of 76 patients. Both BC and BO demonstrated favorable outcomes in bone regeneration and soft tissue healing when used for simultaneous implant placement and bone augmentation.",
39757749,10.1002/cre2.70065,"Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study of Naproxen During Dental Implant Osseointegration.",Clinical and experimental dental research,2025,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often prescribed following the placement of dental implants, but the effects of these drugs on the osseointegration process are poorly understood. We designed a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study to quantitatively assess the effect of NSAIDs during early implant osseointegration. Subjects receiving a maxillary dental implant were randomized to take naproxen or placebo for 7 days after the surgery. Implant osseointegration was quantified using Resonance Frequency Analysis device. Implant-Stability-Quotient (ISQ) measurement was performed at the time of surgery and at follow-up visits 1, 4, and 16 weeks after surgery. Periapical radiographs were taken to measure the marginal bone level. Separately, a questionnaire of NSAIDs usage was provided to subjects presenting with early implant failure. After 4 weeks, ISQ values increased modestly ( + 1%) in subjects receiving naproxen whereas subjects receiving placebo had a much larger increase in ISQ value (+41%). We observed 55% more marginal bone loss at 4 weeks, and 52% at 16 weeks in the naproxen group compared to the placebo group. These results were not found to have statistically significant between groups (p ≥ 0.05). These effect sizes and variance were used to conduct a power analysis to determine the necessary sample size for future studies. Furthermore, our separate questionnaire study revealed that 68% of our patients with early failed dental implants reported a history of NSAIDs usage after the surgery. In conclusion, this pilot study provides effect sizes and sample size estimates for future studies to definitively determine recommendations regarding NSAID usage following dental implant surgery. Nonetheless, our study did not observe any statistically significant differences in ISQ value or marginal bone loss after up to 16 weeks of follow-up between subjects from naproxen and placebo groups.",
39429193,10.1111/clr.14372,Does Injectable Platelet-Rich Fibrin Combined With Autogenous Demineralized Dentine Enhance Alveolar Ridge Preservation? A Randomized Controlled Trial.,Clinical oral implants research,2025,"The present trial evaluated the first-time application of autogenous demineralized dentin graft with injectable platelet-rich fibrin (ADDG + i-PRF) versus autogenous demineralized dentin graft (ADDG), in alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) in the maxillary aesthetic zone. Twenty-two maxillary (n = 22) non-molar teeth indicated for extraction were randomized into two groups (n = 11/group). Extracted teeth were prepared into ADDG, implanted into extraction sockets with or without i-PRF amalgamation and covered by collagen sponge. Cone-beam computed tomography scans at baseline and 6 months were compared to assess ridge-dimensional changes. Keratinized tissue width, patient satisfaction, pain score and chair time were recorded. In the course of dental implant placements at 6 months, bone core biopsies of engrafted sites were obtained and analysed histomorphometrically. Reduction in ridge width was 1.71 ± 1.08 and 1.8 ± 1.35 mm, while reduction in ridge height was 1.11 ± 0.76 and 1.8 ± 0.96 mm for ADDG + i-PRF and ADDG, respectively (p > 0.05). Significant differences in keratinized tissue width reduction were notable between ADDG + i-PRF and ADDG (0.12 ± 0.34 and 0.58 ± 0.34 mm respectively; p = 0.008). Postoperative pain scores were significantly lower in ADDG + i-PRF (p = 0.012). All patients in the two groups were satisfied with no differences in chair time (p > 0.05). No differences in total percentage area of newly formed bone, soft tissue or graft particles were observed between the groups (p > 0.05). ADDG alone or in combination with i-PRF yields similar results regarding ARP clinically, quality of the formed osseous tissues, as well as patients' satisfaction. Yet, the addition of i-PRF to ADDG tends to preserve the keratinized tissue and lessen postoperative pain.",
39400972,10.1111/clr.14370,One-Piece Versus Two-Piece Abutments for Single Crowns in the Esthetic Zone: A Clinical Trial.,Clinical oral implants research,2025,"To evaluate whether a two-piece abutment is equivalent to a one-piece in peri-implant esthetics, patients' satisfaction, and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQOL) for implant-supported anterior single crown placement. Thirty implants were allocated sequentially: 15 in the one-piece abutment group (OP) and 15 in the two-piece abutment group (TP). Peri-implant esthetics were evaluated by the pink esthetic score (PES) at temporary crown insertion (T1), after tissue conditioning (T2), and at 30 days after the final crown insertion (T3). OHRQOL was measured using the OHIP-14 and satisfaction was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) at baseline, T1, and T3. Treatment was considered equivalent if the 95% coefficient interval (CI) for mean difference in PES was between -1.5 and +1.5 points. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney, SPANOVA, and Student's t-test, with Sidak's posttest, adopting p < 0.05. No differences were found between the groups for any variable and during follow-up. A significant increase in OHRQOL and satisfaction was observed at T3, when compared to baseline (p < 0.05) for both groups. Significant improvements in peri-implant esthetics were also observed throughout the treatment, particularly after tissue conditioning (p < 0.05). Primary and secondary outcomes were evaluated for equivalence, and both abutment types were considered equivalent following the insertion of the temporary crowns. Two-piece abutment was equivalent to one-piece abutment for peri-implant esthetics, quality of life, or the satisfaction of patients rehabilitated with metal-free single crowns. Tissue conditioning and final crown insertion appear to play a role in improving these outcomes.",

Patients' experience of pain, aesthetics, and Quality of life were further assessed. One dental implant, per included patient, diagnosed with peri-implant mucositis underwent treatment with an Er:YAG laser (test) or an ultrasonic scaler (control) randomly. Treatments were performed at baseline and months three and six. At each session, oral hygiene was instructed after plaque registration, and the patient was guided in proper cleaning technique using a toothbrush and interproximal aids as needed. Full mouth bleeding on probing (FMBoP), full mouth plaque score (FMPS), implant bleeding on probing (BoP), implant mean graded bleeding (mBI), implant probing pocket depts (PPD), implant suppuration and bone levels were assessed. Oral health-related Quality of life (OHQoL) and visual analog scales (VAS), which reflect aesthetic satisfaction and pain of the treatment, were also evaluated. Forty-six patients were included. FMBoP was significantly reduced from 30.1 to 21.5% (test) (p < 0.001) respectively from 35.0% to 30% (control) (p < 0.01). FMPS showed significant reduction from 61.5 to 32.7% (test) (p < 0.001) and from 58.7 to 39.1% (control) (p < 0.001). At the implant BoP reduced from 89.0 to 55.7% (test) (p < 0.001) respectively from 94.9 to 63.7% (control) (p < 0.001). mBI was reduced from 1.3 to 0.6 (test) (p < 0.01) and from 1.9 to 0.8 (control) (p < 0.001). Distribution of ""no bleeding"" increased from 13 to 61% (test) (p < 0.05) and from 0 to 35% (control) (p < 0.05). At month three, statistically significant intergroup differences were shown for PPD ≥ 4 mm with 43.5% (test) respectively 73.9% (control) (p < 0.05). At month six, statistically significant intergroup differences, were shown for FMBoP 21.5% (test) respectively 30% (control) (p < 0.05) and for plaque score at the implant 4.0% (test) respectively 26% (control) (p < 0.05). Less pain was reported in the laser group at three days 0.08 (test) respectively 0.2 (control) (p < 0.05).
