Woxuanzhongzhou formula improves DHEAS and high-fat diet-induced IR and anovulatory mice via AMPK/PGC1- Î±/Irisin pathway,"Liu H., Wang G., Sui C., Guo Y., He X.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic disorder in women of reproductive age. Anovulation is one of the most important clinical features of PCOS, and insulin resistance (IR) is one of the critical pathogenic factors. Woxuanzhongzhou (WXZZ) is a traditional herbal formulation that has shown efficacy in treating PCOS combined with IR, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of WXZZ on dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and high fat diet induced PCOS with IR mice. Methods: 40 female C57BL/6 mice were randomized to 4 groups: control group, model group, metformin group, and WXZZ group. Some mice is induced by dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA) and high-fat diet (HFD) for 3 weeks. Following model induction, metformin and WXZZ were administered by gavage. Body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS) levels, the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and gonadal hormones were measured. Estrous cycles were monitored. The structure of the gastrocnemius muscle and subcutaneous fatty tissue were also evaluated. Additionally, serum irisin and non-esterified fatty acids (NEAF) levels and the protein and gene expression levels of AMPK, PGC1-Î±, FNDC5, irisin in the gastrocnemius muscle and CaMKK, AMPK, PGC1-Î±, UCP1 in fat were analyzed. Results: The DHEA + HFD + WXZZ group exhibited significant improvements in several key parameters compared to the DHEA + HFD group. WXZZ ameliorated endocrine and metabolic disorders, resumed estrous cycle in DHEAS and high-fat diet-induced IR and anovulatory mice. Significant reductions were observed in body weight, serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone, luteinizing hormone/ follicle-stimulating hormone ratio, FINS, and HOMA-IR. Additionally, WXZZ promoted irisin expression and secretion by up-regulating the protein and gene AMPK/PGC1-Î±/FNDC5 expression in gastrocnemius muscle and up-regulated the protein and gene CaMKK/AMPK/PGC1-Î±/UCP1 expression in fat. WXZZ inhibited the overproduction of serum NEFA, and reduced lipid accumulation. Structural analysis of the gastrocnemius muscle and adipose tissue revealed partial restoration. Conclusion: WXZZ exhibits therapeutic effects in DHEAS and high-fat diet-induced IR and anovulatory mice. These effects may be mediated through the activation of AMPK/PGC1-Î± pathway in muscle to promote the secretion of irisin.","fibronectin (86088-83-7), follitropin (9002-68-0), glucose (50-99-7, 84778-64-3, 8027-56-3), hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase (172522-01-9, 72060-32-3), insulin (9004-10-8), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9), prasterone sulfate (651-48-9), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.1186/s13048-025-01587-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13048-025-01587-5,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2033127945&from=export,,"Copyright 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Interventions for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in Indian Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Maan P., Gautam R., Vasudevan S., Menon G.R., Arora A., Nair A., Jabbar P.K., Arora T.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder prevalent in women of reproductive age. Treatment or management of this syndrome includes several pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches for different manifestations of the disease that vary with the patient?™s age, symptoms, requirements, and geographical location. Objective: This systematic review aims to conduct a comprehensive and evidence-based analysis of the various available treatment options and identify knowledge gaps in PCOS management in India. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases from January 2010 till February 2024. We included randomized control trials (RCTs) using any pharmacological drugs (e.g., insulin sensitizers, anti-androgens, anti-obesity drugs, oral contraceptive pills, ovulation induction drugs, etc.) or non-pharmacological intervention (e.g., yoga, diet, herbal supplements, etc.) with Indian PCOS patients for improving common manifestations of PCOS and written in the English language. Studies were screened by two authors independently in a two-level process. Data extraction was also performed by two authors. Risk of bias was performed using the RoB 2 Tool. Subgroup analysis and meta-analysis were performed using the RevMan tool. Results: Thirty RCTs on pharmacological and eight on non-pharmacological interventions were included in the study. However, all the RCTs were so heterogeneous in terms of intervention used, subject recruited, and outcomes measured that meta-analysis was possible for only three subgroups (metformin vs. inositol, metformin vs. metformin+ inositol, and letrozole vs. clomiphene citrate), with only two or three studies per analysis. Most studies were single-centric and small-sized and had a high risk of bias, limiting their generalizability. Conclusions: This systematic review synthesized existing research and evaluated the effectiveness and safety of existing treatments. Limitations and gaps in the current research were identified, which may inform future research for better understanding and management of PCOS in the Indian context.","atorvastatin (134523-00-5, 134523-03-8, 110862-48-1), clomifene citrate (50-41-9), empagliflozin (864070-44-0), inositol (55608-27-0, 6917-35-7, 87-89-8), letrozole (112809-51-5), metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9), naltrexone (16590-41-3, 16676-29-2), orlistat (96829-58-2), rimonabant (158681-13-1, 168273-06-1), sibutramine (106650-56-0), sitagliptin (486460-32-6, 654671-78-0, 654671-77-9, 486459-71-6, 2088771-60-0)",,10.3390/ph18050680,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ph18050680,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2034731501&from=export,,"Copyright 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
"COMPARATIVE STUDY ON SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE DECOCTIONS OF SESAMUM INDICUM, NIGELLA SATIVA AND ITS COMBINATION ON POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME","Deepthika S.H.K., Karunagoda K.P.K.R., Perera P.K.","This study investigated the efficacy and safety of three herbal decoctions for managing Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a condition affecting 2-26% of women globally and considered incurable within allopathic medicine and offers symptomatic treatments. This randomized, single-blind clinical trial, conducted between February 2022 and June 2024, enrolled 90 PCOS patients diagnosed by the Rotterdam (2003) criteria. Participants were randomly allocated into three intervention groups: Nigella sativa (Arm I), Sesamum indicum (Arm II), and a combination of both (Arm III). Each group received 30 ml of the assigned decoction twice daily over three months. Clinical parameters were assessed using established grading scales, including androgenic alopecia, hirsutism, acne, and acanthosis nigricans. Additionally, ultrasound scans (USS) were performed pre- and post-treatment to evaluate changes in ovarian morphology. Results indicated a significant reduction in ovarian volume for Arms I (P=0.029) and II (P=0.008) and an increase in follicle size across all three arms. The number of participants with polycystic ovarian morphology significantly decreased in Arm I (P=0.016) and II (P=0.004). However, one-way ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences between the three groups regarding subjective clinical symptoms or objective ultrasound parameters. The study concludes that all three interventions effectively regulate menstruation and enhance follicular maturity. Among the three, the combined therapy of Nigella sativa and Sesamum indicum (Arm III) demonstrated the most pronounced benefits. These findings suggest that Nigella sativa and Sesamum indicum, individually or in combination, hold potential as therapeutic options for PCOS management without any side effects.",,,10.13040/IJPSR.0975-8232.16(5).1300-07,http://dx.doi.org/10.13040/IJPSR.0975-8232.16(5).1300-07,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2038543053&from=export,,"Copyright 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
A diagnostic model for polycystic ovary syndrome based on machine learning,"Tong C., Wu Y., Zhuang Z., Yu Y.","Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome remains a challenge. In this study, we propose constructing a diagnostic model of polycystic ovary syndrome by combining anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone with steroid hormones and oestrogens, with the aim of providing more bases and auxiliary means for the diagnosis of this disease. 1. Eighty-four samples from patients who were diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University from May 2023 to November 2023 were collected as the case group, and 75 samples from the healthy population of the Health Screening Centre of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University during the same period were collected as the control group. 2. General information (including age, BMI, family history, medication history, etc.) and sex hormone data (including luteinising hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, prolactin, estradiol, testosterone, etc.) were collected from all study subjects. AMH and steroid hormone tests were performed on serum collected from all study subjects. 3. The data of 10 case groups and 10 control groups were randomly selected as validation set data, and the rest of the data were included in the model construction. The acquired data were screened for variables, a classification model based on a machine learning algorithm was constructed, and the constructed model was evaluated and validated for diagnostic efficacy. Ultimately, a total of 8 variables were screened and included in the subsequent model construction, namely LH, LH/FSH, E2, PRL, T, AMH, AD, and COR, with AMH having the highest diagnostic potential among all the variables included in the model. A total of five machine learning models were constructed, the logistic classification model has the best overall performance, and the support vector machine has the weakest overall performance. The validation set has an AUC of 0.86 for the model. In this study, five classification models based on machine learning algorithms were successfully constructed. Combining the evaluation metrics of each model performance, we concluded that the logistic classification model had the best performance capability in our study. However, since this study is a single-center small sample size study, some metabolic features of PCOS may be overlooked, and, as the validation set data in this study come from the same center as the modelling data, the validation results may have several limitations, so it is still necessary to expand the sample size and collect multicenter data to establish an external validation dataset to further improve the study.","follitropin (9002-68-0), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), Muellerian inhibiting factor (80497-65-0), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.1038/s41598-025-92630-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92630-4,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L646970005&from=export,,"This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"
Systematic review and meta-analysis of animal experiments on Bushen formulas for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome,"Cui Y., Zhang C., Li X., Cui Y., Gao L., Wang P.","The treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with Bushen traditional Chinese medicine has a long history. Every year, there are animal experiments on Bushen formulas for the treatment of PCOS. The evidence from these preclinical studies is still unclear. This study summarizes and evaluates the animal experimental results of Bushen formulas in the treatment of PCOS. To explore the effects of using Bushen formulas to treat animal models of PCOS on body weight, sexual disorders and insulin resistance. As of 9 October 2023, this review made a detailed search of eight databases to look for random controlled trials (RCTs) focused on the use of Bushen formulas in PCOS animal models. Conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the included literature. Screening of the literature was performed independently, and data were extracted and assessed. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 software. Compared with the model group, the animals treated with Bushen formulas showed a decrease in ovarian mass (MD = - 1.01, 95% CI = [- 1.5, - 0.52], P < 0.0001), testosterone (T) level (MD = - 2.57, 95% CI = [- 2.91, - 2.23], P < 0.00001), body weight (MD = - 22.07, 95% CI = [- 31.12, - 13.03], P < 0.00001), luteinizing hormone (LH) level (MD = - 1.43, 95% CI = [- 1.79, - 1.08], P < 0.00001), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) level (MD = - 3.26, 95% CI = [- 4.5]). - 2.02%, P < 0.00001), and an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level (MD = 0.96, 95% CI = [0.61, 1.30], P < 0.00001). The use of Bushen formulas can reduce ovarian mass, testosterone, body weight, LH, HOMA-IR, increase FSH in animal models, and improve symptoms related to polycystic ovary syndrome. However, the heterogeneities between studies are too high, therefore, we need to further investigate their potential mechanisms in order to guide clinical medication better.","follitropin (9002-68-0), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.1038/s41598-025-89725-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-89725-3,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L646732076&from=export,,"This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"

Improvement of endocrine and metabolic conditions in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome through acupuncture and its combined therapies: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Wu T., Liu Y., Kong F., Hu J., Liu Y., Yang J., Chen J.","Background: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age that significantly impacts their reproductive health. Acupuncture and its combined therapies may have beneficial effects on the endocrine and metabolic states of women with PCOS. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the treatment effects and potential mechanisms of acupuncture and its combined therapies compared to oral metformin in treating PCOS patients. Methods: The evaluation focused on three sets of outcomes: hormonal indicators, metabolic indicators, and body weight indicators. Studies that involved additional therapies beyond the specified interventions or included patients with other diseases were excluded. Additionally, data mining methods were used, including frequency statistics to analyze the frequency of acupuncture points and the meridians involved, and the Apriori algorithm to perform association rule analysis for the most effective interventions. Results: The study included 46 articles (51 studies) involving six interventions: acupuncture combined with metformin, acupuncture treatment, acupuncture with Chinese herbal medicine and metformin, acupuncture with Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture combined with cupping, and auricular acupuncture combined with metformin showed significant improvements in all evaluated indicators. Data mining revealed the Stomach meridian of foot yangming was the most frequently used, and the most commonly used combination of points included CV4, SP6, and ST36. Conclusions: This study suggests that acupuncture and its combined therapies may benefit PCOS. However, risk of bias and heterogeneity observed were noted. Future high-quality, rigorously designed randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and provide stronger clinical recommendations for acupuncture in PCOS treatment.","follitropin (9002-68-0), glucose (50-99-7, 84778-64-3, 8027-56-3), insulin (9004-10-8), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9)",,10.1080/07853890.2025.2477295,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2025.2477295,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2033679851&from=export,,"Copyright 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Phytotherapy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Management: A Systematic Review,"Mohamed S.S., Allam A.T., El-Alfy A.N., El-Shiekh R.A., Reda A.M., Abd El Hafeez M.S.","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent medical condition that encompasses both metabolic and reproductive disorders. Various pharmaceutical interventions have been proposed for managing PCOS; however, the potential side effects associated with long-term use and their often-limited efficacy have prompted interest in complementary and alternative therapies. Recent studies indicate a growing trend toward the utilization of these alternative treatments. Medicinal herbs have historically been employed to address gynecological and infertility issues in individuals with PCOS. This study aims to systematically review the herbal remedies utilized for PCOS on a global scale. A comprehensive search was conducted across several databases, focusing on clinical trials, especially randomized controlled trials from 2010 to 2024. The findings from numerous studies suggest that a diverse array of herbal medicines may enhance various aspects of PCOS management.

Integrating East Asian Traditional Medicine into Assisted Reproductive Technology: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Peng X., Wu B., Zhou S., Xu Y., Ogihara A., Nishimura S., Jin Q.","Background: Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are essential for treating infertility but often face limited success due to issues like poor embryo implantation and low live birth rates. East Asian traditional medicine (EATM), including acupuncture and herbal medicine, may help address these challenges by improving physiological responses in ART cycles. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of EATM, specifically acupuncture and herbal medicine, in enhancing clinical pregnancy and live birth outcomes for women undergoing ART. Primary Study Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of EATM, specifically acupuncture and herbal medicine, in enhancing clinical pregnancy and live birth outcomes for women undergoing ART. Methods/Design: This study, registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023411712), systematically searched 11 databases up to March 31, 2023. Randomized controlled trials comparing EATM interventions with control groups were included, with two authors independently extracting data and assessing methodological quality. Statistical methods such as meta-regression and subgroup analyses were used to explore heterogeneity. Meta-analysis was performed using the inverse-variance method in Stata 12.0. Setting: The trials analyzed took place in fertility clinics across various countries, predominantly in East Asia, with some trials from Europe and North America. Most were conducted in specialized reproductive health centers. Participants: A total of 10 776 participants (aged 29-38) from 37 randomized controlled trials. Participants included women with various infertility issues, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), bilateral tubal blockage, diminished ovarian reserve and unexplained infertility. Intervention: Acupuncture therapies included classic body acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, laser acupuncture, and auricular acupuncture. Herbal treatments included powders, pills, granules, decoctions, and ointments derived from traditional Chinese herbal formulas such as Zishen Yutai Pills and Liuwei Dihuang Granule. Primary Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes were clinical pregnancy rates (as confirmed by ultrasound) and live birth rates (defined as delivery of a living child). Secondary outcomes included embryo implantation rates (measured by ultrasound) and the incidence of adverse events. Results: EATM interventions significantly improved clinical pregnancy rates (CPR) (Risk Ratio [RR] 1.316, 95% CI 1.171-1.480) and live birth rates (LBR) (RR 1.287, 95% CI 1.081-1.533). Herbal medicine also enhanced CPR (RR 1.184, 95% CI 1.017-1.379) and LBR (RR 1.147, 95% CI 1.010-1.303). Subgroup analyses showed true acupuncture was more effective than sham acupuncture for CPR (RR 1.218, 95% CI 1.019-1.455), while herbal medicine outperformed placebo in CPR improvement (RR 1.211, 95% CI 1.071-1.370). No significant differences were observed in adverse events (AEs) or dropout rates, indicating the interventions' safety. Conclusions: EATM, particularly acupuncture and herbal medicine, shows promise as a complementary therapy to improve pregnancy and live birth outcomes in ART. These findings suggest potential clinical benefits in incorporating EATM into fertility treatments, though further research is warranted to optimize protocols and confirm long-term effects.",,,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L645855196&from=export,,"This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"
Research trends and hotspots of acupuncture therapy for obesity from 2004 to 2023: A bibliometric analysis,"Wang J., Cao K., Chen Z., Lyu T., Xia Q., Liu L., Li B.","Background: Acupuncture has been increasingly used in obese people, yet no bibliometric analysis of acupuncture studies for obesity exists. This bibliometric study analyzed research trends, cooperation, and knowledge dissemination on acupuncture for obesity over the past 20 years to inform future directions. Objectives: To investigate the characteristics, hotspots, and frontiers of global scientific output in acupuncture research for obesity over the past two decades. Methods: We retrieved publications on acupuncture for obesity published from 2004 to 2023 from the Web of Science Core Collection. Using Citespace, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix, we analyzed and visualized the publications, countries, institutions, authors, journals, and keywords from various angles. Results: A total of 357 articles were retrieved. The results showed that the number of annual publications on acupuncture for obesity has increased over time. China had the most publications (217 articles, 60.87 %), with Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (24 articles, 6.72 %) as the most prolific institution. Ergene Neyhan, Huang Wei, and Zhou Zhongyu were the most productive authors (9 articles), and the article published by Cho SH in 2009 was the most cited article (60 citations). The most published journal was Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, while the Journal of American Journal of Chinese Medicine was the most frequently cited. Recently, ?œelectroacupuncture???œinsulin resistance??and ?œsystematic review??appeared frequently. The research hotspots and trends of acupuncture for obesity mainly focus on interventions, hotspot diseases, and mechanism exploration. According to keyword analysis, randomized controlled trials of catgut embedding and mechanistic studies of gut flora are the trends for future research. Conclusion: Although China is the leading producer, multinational co-operation still needs to be strengthened. Currently, the main interventions for obesity were acupuncture and electroacupuncture, and the hot diseases were obesity combined with polycystic ovary syndrome and metabolic syndrome.

Efficacy of a Persian herbal remedy and electroacupuncture on the Quality of Life in Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Rouhani M., Motevasselian M., Avval S.B.","Background and Aim: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is known as the most common endocrine disorder with a high prevalence among women of childbearing age. Due to the importance of discovering new methods for the treatment of PCOS patients and the limited studies assessing the effect of Iranian traditional medicine (ITM) on the management of these patients, we sought to determine the effect of ITM and acupuncture on the quality of life indexes in patients with PCOS. Methods: This was a randomized control trial (RTC), which was performed on 78 obese or overweight women with PCOS who were referred to university clinics or infertility centers of Imam Reza and Ghaem hospitals, Mashhad, Iran. In this study the patients were assigned to four groups of 20 (i.e., metformin, ITM (herbal therapy) plus metformin, acupuncture plus metformin, and acupuncture and ITM plus metformin). Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome questionnaire (PCOSQ) that designed by Cronin et al. was completed before and after the intervention. Results: Comparison of different therapies in PCOS patients showed a significant difference between the preand post-treatment scores of emotional status in the metformin (t=-3.14, P=0.006), ITM (t=-7.76, P=0.001), acupuncture plus metformin (t=-5.19, P=0.001), and ITM and acupuncture (t=-7.13, P=0.001) groups. Also, we observed a significant difference between the scores obtained pre- and post-treatment in terms of hirsutism in the metformin (t=-2.81, P=0.01), ITM (t=-4.72, P=0.001), acupuncture plus metformin (t=-4.001, P=0.001), and ITM plus acupuncture (t=-4.75, P=0.001) groups. The comparison between the four groups showed a significant difference in terms of hirsutism between the metformin alone and TIM groups (P=0.02). Conclusion: Considering the clinical improvement in intervention groups, it is recommended to use complementary methods, especially herbal remedies, in patients with PCOS syndrome who have some degrees of overweight and hirsutism.","metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9)",,10.18502/tim.v9is1.16695,http://dx.doi.org/10.18502/tim.v9is1.16695,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L645778284&from=export,,"Copyright 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
"Comparison of the Effect of Auriculotherapy, an Herbal Compound (Aslagh Capsule), and Metformin on the Clinical Symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Randomized Clinical Trial","Ghanbarian R., Valiani M., Allameh Z., Ranjbar M., Mazaheri M.","Background and Aim: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that affects women of child-bearing age, with a worldwide prevalence ranging from 6 to 20%. Considering the potential side effects of chemical medications and the need for long-term drug administration, complementary treatments such as acupuncture, auriculotherapy, and herbal medicine have been considered. Hence, this study was designed to compare the effects of auriculotherapy, an herbal component (Aslagh capsule), and metformin on the clinical symptoms of PCOS. Methods: This is a randomized controlled clinical trial study, which allocated 24 women, aged 18-43 years old, with oligomenorrhea in PCOs, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to three groups Results: A decreasing pattern in the duration of the menstrual cycle was observed in all three groups, but this was significant only in the auriculotherapy group. There were no significant differences between the three groups in acne and hirsutism scores. However, there was a significant reduction in excess hair growth and density of hair in the auriculotherapy group compared to the other two groups (P < 0.05). Besides, in the auriculotherapy group, the reduction in thickness of excess hair at the end of the second and third months of treatment were marginally significant compared to the two other groups Conclusion: Auriculotherapy and Aslagh capsule can be effective in reducing PCOS symptoms, similar to metformin. However, auriculotherapy is more effective than the other treatments in reducing the duration of the menstrual cycle, excess hair growth, and hair density.","metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9)",,10.18502/tim.v9is1.16695,http://dx.doi.org/10.18502/tim.v9is1.16695,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L645778398&from=export,,"Copyright 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Effect of cinnamon as a Chinese herbal medicine on markers of cardiovascular risk in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Xiaomei Z., Xiaoyan F.","Introduction: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder in women associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Cinnamon, a Chinese herbal medicine, is known for its anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties, making it a potential therapeutic agent for PCOS-related cardiovascular complications. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of cinnamon supplementation on cardiovascular risk markers in women diagnosed with PCOS. Methods: Twelve randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the analysis. The primary outcomes assessed were body weight, insulin resistance measured by Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and fasting blood sugar (FBS). Results: The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant effect of cinnamon on reducing weight. Under the random-effects model, the pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) was ??.47 kg (95 % CI: ??.80 to ??.15, p < 0.001; I2 = 0.0 %). There was also a beneficial impact on insulin resistance, with reduced HOMA-IR scores following cinnamon supplementation (SMD=0.5015, 95 % CI: 0.2496 to 0.7533, p < 0.0001). Additionally, there was a significant improvement in FBS levels (pooled WMD: ??.72 mg/dL, 95 % CI: ??2.33 to ??.12, p < 0.001; I2 = 91.3 %). The meta-analysis indicated a tendency towards reduced total cholesterol (WMD: ??1.12 mg/dL, 95 % CI: ??9.06 to ??.18, p = 0.01; I2 = 0.0 %) and LDL levels (WMD: ??1.11 mg/dL, 95 % CI: ??8.22 to ??.00, p < 0.01; I2 = 0.0 %) following cinnamon intervention. Substantial heterogeneity was observed among the studies, indicating the need for further research with larger sample sizes and standardized methodologies. Conclusion: Cinnamon supplementation demonstrates promising effects on body weight, blood sugar, total cholesterol, LDL, and insulin resistance in women with PCOS, indicating its potential in mitigating cardiovascular risk factors associated with this condition.","metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9)",,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2024.07.032,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2024.07.032,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2033468289&from=export,,"Copyright 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Combined traditional Chinese medicine therapy for the treatment of infertility with polycystic ovary syndrome: A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Deng Y.-P., Zhou Y.-L., Wei T.-T., He G.-S., Zhu Z.-X., Zhang S.-N., Liu M.-J., Xue J.-J., Zhang W.-X., Yang X.-G.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) infertility has attracted great attention from researchers due to its high incidence. Numerous studies have shown that Chinese medicine is effective in treating this disease, but there is a wide variety of Chinese medicine therapies available, and there is a lack of comparative evaluation of the efficacy of various Chinese medicine combination therapies in the clinic, which requires further in-depth exploration. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a combined traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy for the treatment of infertility with PCOS using network meta-analysis (NMA). Methods: In PubMed, web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, China Knowledge Network, Wanfang Data, VIP Database, China Biomedical Literature Database (SinoMed) databases, searchs were conducted for information about the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of combined TCM therapy for the treatment of infertility with PCOS. Quality evaluation was performed using the Cochrane 5.3 risk of bias assessment tool, and NMA using Stata 16.0. Results: This study comprised 28 RCTs using 8 combined TCM therapies in total. The results of the NMA showed that moxibustion + herbal, fire acupuncture + herbal, acupuncture + herbal, electroacupuncture + herbal, and acupoint application + herbal improved the clinical pregnancy rate better than acupuncture, herbal, and western medicines monotherapy (P < .05). Additionally, ear point pressure + herbal enema + herbal, acupuncture and moxibustion + herbal, fire acupuncture + herbal, and acupuncture + herbal improved the ovulation rate better than acupuncture, herbal, and western medicines monotherapy (P < .05). Moxibustion + herbal, fire acupuncture + herbal, and acupuncture + herbal are the 3 most effective therapies for improving the clinical pregnancy rate. Fire acupuncture + herbal, acupuncture + herbal, and ear point pressure + herbal enema + herbal are the 3 most effective therapies for improving the ovulation rate. Conclusion: The combined TCM therapy demonstrated better efficacy for the treatment of infertility with PCOS compared to acupuncture, herbal, and western medicines monotherapy. However, the optimal treatment therapy varied depending on the outcome indicators. Further large sample, high-quality, and standardized RCTs are needed to verify these findings.","clomifene (911-45-5), letrozole (112809-51-5), metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9)",,10.1097/MD.0000000000038912,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000038912,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2033317664&from=export,,"Copyright 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
The intervention effect of Lycium barbarum leaves on letrozole-induced PCOS mice based on microbiome,"Zhang X.-Y., Lu C., Zheng H.-L., Su S.-L., Zhu Y., Guo S., Qian D.-W., Kang H.-J., Duan J.-A.","The purpose of this study was to investigate the intervention effect and mechanism of Lycium barbarum leaves on letrozole-induced polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) mice. The PCOS model was prepared by letrozole combined with high-fat diet. After successful modeling, 40 mice were randomly divided into PCOS group, positive drug metformin group, low-dose Lycium barbarum leaves group, and high-dose Lycium barbarum leaves group. The corresponding drugs were given by gavage for 29 days. At the end of the experiment, the eyeballs were removed for blood collection and ovarian tissue was collected. The ovarian mass, fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), testosterone (T), anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and estradiol (E(2)) levels were measured in each group. The morphology of ovarian tissue was observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining, and the oocytes, cystic follicles and corpus luteum were counted. Cecal contents of mice were collected for analysis of intestinal flora composition and differential flora. The animal experiment process was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The results showed that the estrous cycle of PCOS mice was disordered. Compared with the PCOS group, the Lycium barbarum leaves group can significantly reduce the ovarian damage of mice, reduce the number of cystic dilated follicles, and normalize the estrous cycle. After the intervention of Lycium barbarum leaves, the levels of FBG, FINS, T, AMH, LH, FSH and LH/FSH were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), while the level of E(2)was significantly increased (P < 0.001). In addition, Lycium barbarum leaves can regulate the disorder of intestinal flora diversity in PCOS mice, increase the abundance of Bacteroidetes, and reduce the abundance of Firmicutes, Ileibacterium, Romboutsia and Faecalibaculum. In summary, Lycium barbarum leaves can play a therapeutic role in PCOS mice by improving insulin resistance, regulating reproductive hormone disorders and gut microbiota imbalance.

The effect of aqueous extract of orchid root on the structure of ovary and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal hormones in polycystic ovary syndrome rat model: An experimental study,"Abedi H., Zarrin-Mehr A., Ebrahimi B., Haghshenas H., Parvin N., Kargar Jahromi H.","Background: Some medical conditions, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOs), may lead to infertility. In PCOs, hormonal imbalance is significant. Antioxidants such as natural antioxidants have many health benefits, including positive effects on hormone production. Objective: Since herbal medicines are more acceptable to people, the present study was designed to evaluate the effect of an aqueous extract of orchid (SA), with antioxidative effects, on the structure of the ovary and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis hormones and free testosterone in PCOs rats. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 64 healthy female Wistar rats (180??00 gr) were randomly divided into 60 and 89 day control groups, PCOs, and 4 PCOs + SA groups that received 40, 80, 160, and 320 mg/kg of SA. Serum levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone were measured. In addition, the ovaries were extracted and examined histologically. Results: The amount of primordial, primary, secondary, and Graafian follicles and serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and progesterone hormones decreased in PCOs groups, while atretic follicles and the serum levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone, estrogen, and free testosterone were increased. SA at different doses regulated hormonal and histological imbalances caused by PCOs, and 320 mg/kg was the most effective. Conclusion: The aqueous extract of orchids root can have a positive effect on the improvement of polycystic ovary syndrome.

"The effect of Ding-kun-dan comparing with Marvelon on primary dysmenorrhea: A prospective, double-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial","Gan J., Zhu S.-Y., Ma X., Ding X.-S., Deng Y., Wang Y., Sun A.-J.","Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ding-kun-dan (DKD), as one of well-known traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is considered as an effective prescription to regulate menstruation, benefit Qi and nourish the blood. Previous studies had showed that DKD could improve sex hormone levels, insulin resistance, metabolism abnormalities and regulate immunity in animal models with polycystic ovary syndrome or endometriosis, however, little study conducted to reveal its clinical efficacy in Primary Dysmenorrhea (PD). Aim of the study: To compare the effect of Ding-kun-dan (DKD) with Marvelon on relief of symptoms and change of serum pain-related factors in patients with primary dysmenorrhea. Materials and method: 136 patients with primary dysmenorrhea were randomly assigned to the DKD group (n = 73, take one tablet per day from 5th day of the menstrual cycle for 10 days every 28 days) and the Marvelon group (n = 63, take one tablet per day from 5th day of the menstrual cycle for 21 days every 28 days), the therapeutic effects were analyzed through evaluating the change of VAS scores, CMSS scores and the level of PGF(2a), PGE(2), PGF(2a)/PGE(2) and NO during the 12 weeks intervention. Results: Both DKD and Marvelon could effectively relief pain and other associated symptoms at each visit (Baseline, 4(th) week, 8(th) week and 12(th) week). Although Marvelon was significantly superior to DKD in reducing VAS scores, the total CMSS, CMSS severity and duration scores at each posttreatment follow-up (P < 0.01), VAS scores in the DKD group decreased significantly over time while scores in the COC group only dropped rapidly after the first two months of treatment. Efficacy gap between two interventions continuously narrowed over time and the efficacy of DKD became non-inferior at the 12(th) week compared to that of Marvelon (the difference between groups, ??0.78%; 95% confidence interval (CI), ??3.67%??2.75%; non-inferiority margin, 15%). DKD group had better efficacy on mild pain compared to that of the COC group with no statistical difference (75% VS 61.9%, P > 0.05). DKD and Marvelon could effectively reduce PGF(2a), PGE(2) and higher PGF(2a)/PGE(2) in patients with PD. There was no statistical difference in the level of PGF(2a), PGE(2), PGF(2a)/PGE(2) and NO between DKD and Marvelon group at each follow-up. No serious adverse effect was observed.

Bushen Huoxue Recipe inhibits endometrial epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the transforming growth factor-Î²/nuclear factor kappa-B pathway to improve polycystic ovary syndrome-mediated infertility,"Wu H., Wu P., Zhu Y., Li J., Chen H., Zhu H.","Objective: To investigate the target and mechanism of action of Bushen Huoxue Recipe (BSHX) for the treatment of infertility in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), to provide a basis for the development and clinical application of herbal compounds. Methods: Prediction and validation of active ingredients and targets of BSHX for the treatment of PCOS by using network pharmacology-molecular docking technology. In an animal experiment, the rats were randomly divided into four groups (control group, model group, BSHX group, metformin group, n = 16 in each group), and letrozole combined with high-fat emulsion gavage was used to establish a PCOS rat model. Body weight, vaginal smears, and number of embryos were recorded for each group of rats. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was used to observe the morphological changes of ovarian and endometrial tissues, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the serum inflammatory factor levels. Expression levels of transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²), transforming growth factor beta activated kinase 1 (TAK1), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-ÎºB), Vimentin, and E-cadherin proteins were measured by western blot (WB). Results: Ninety active pharmaceutical ingredients were obtained from BSHX, involving 201 protein targets, of which 160 were potential therapeutic targets. The active ingredients of BSHX exhibited lower binding energy with tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), TGF-Î², TAK1, and NF-ÎºB protein receptors (< ??.0 kcal/mol). BSHX significantly reduced serum TNF-Î± levels in PCOS rats (p <.01), effectively regulated the estrous cycle, restored the pathological changes in the ovary and endometrium, improved the pregnancy rate, and increased the number of embryos. The results of WB suggested that BSHX can down-regulate protein expression levels of TGF-Î² and NF-ÎºB in endometrial tissue (p <.05), promote the expression level of E-cadherin protein (p <.001), intervene in the endometrial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Conclusions: TGF-Î², TAK1, NF-ÎºB, and TNF-Î± are important targets of BSHX for treating infertility in PCOS. BSHX improves the inflammatory state of PCOS, intervenes in the endometrial EMT process through the TGF-Î²/NF-ÎºB pathway, and restores endometrial pathological changes, further improving the pregnancy outcome in PCOS.","letrozole (112809-51-5), metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9), uvomorulin (112956-45-3)",,10.1080/09513590.2024.2325000,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09513590.2024.2325000,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2028974960&from=export,,"Copyright 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Plant medicine metabolite Yulinzhu treating neurological disorder causing polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and a meta-analysis,"Jiao B., Chen R., Chen S., Zhang J., Wang P., Zhou H., Zhao W.","Background: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine disorder that affects women of reproductive age, characterized by chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology. Emerging evidence indicates that neurological disorders play a significant role in the etiology of PCOS, highlighting the complex interplay between the central nervous system (CNS) and ovarian function. Yulinzhu, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulation, has been traditionally used to regulate menstrual cycles and improve fertility. This study aims to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of Yulinzhu in treating PCOS induced by neurological disorders. Methods: An extensive literature search was performed across electronic databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), covering publications up to 1 June 2024. The review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared Yulin Zhu with placebo, standard care, or other active treatments in patients with PCOS. Two reviewers independently carried out data extraction and quality assessment. Meta-analyses were conducted using both fixed and random-effects models, with heterogeneity evaluated using the I(2) statistic. Results: We screened 891 records and included 6 studi es in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that Yulinzhu about effective rate [RR = 1.19, 95% CI (1.10, 1.29), p < 0.0001], pregnancy rate [RR = 2.80, 95% CI (1.65, 4.76), p < 0.0001] and ovulation rate [RR = 1.33, 95% CI (1.10, 1.62), p = 0.04].

Combining single-cell RNA sequencing and network pharmacology to explore the target of cangfu daotan decoction in the treatment of obese polycystic ovary syndrome from an immune perspective,"Liu D., Wei C., Guan L., Ju W., Xiang S., Lian F.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous gynecological endocrine disorder linked to immunity. Cangfu Daotan Decoction (CFDT), a classic Chinese medicine prescription, is particularly effective in treating PCOS, specifically in patients with obesity; however, its specific mechanism remains unclear. Methods: Part 1: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected on egg retrieval day from obese and normal-weight patients with PCOS and healthy women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF)-embryo transfer. Next, scRNA-seq was performed to screen the key genes of bese patients with PCOS. Part 2: Active ingredients of CFDT and obesity-related PCOS targets were identified based on public databases, and the binding ability between the active ingredients and targets was analyzed. Part 3: This part was a monocentric, randomized controlled trial. The obese women with PCOS were randomized to CFDT (6 packets/day) or placebo, and the healthy women were included in the blank control group (43 cases per group). The clinical manifestations and laboratory outcomes among the three groups were compared. Results: Based on the scRNA-seq data from Part 1, CYLD, ARPC3, CXCR4, RORA, JUN, FGL2, ZEB2, GNLY, FTL, SMAD3, IL7R, KIR2DL1, CTSD, BTG2, CCL5, HLA, RETN, CTSZ, and NCF2 were potential key genes associated with obese PCOS were identified. The proportions of T, B, and natural killer cells were higher in patients with PCOS compared to healthy women, with even higher proportions observed in obese patients with PCOS. Gene ontology and the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis depicted that the differentially expressed genes were related to immune regulation pathways. Network pharmacology analysis identified that the key active components in CFDT were quercetin, carvacrol, Î²-sitosterol, cholesterol, and nobiletin, and TP53, AKT1, STAT3, JUN, SRC, etc. were the core targets. The core targets and their enrichment pathways overlapped with those in Part 1. Clinical trials in Part 3 found that CFDT reduced the dosage of gonadotropins use in patients with PCOS, increased the number of high-quality embryos, and improved the ongoing pregnancy rate. Conclusion: CFDT can improve the immune microenvironment of patients to some extent, reduce their economic burden, and enhance IVF outcomes. The improvement in the immune microenvironment in obese patients with PCOS may be linked to targets such as JUN and AKT.","carvacrol (499-75-2), cholesterol (57-88-5), chorionic gonadotropin (9002-61-3), estradiol (50-28-2), follitropin (9002-68-0), gonadotropin (63231-54-9), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), nobiletin (478-01-3), quercetin (117-39-5), sitosterol (19044-06-5, 83-46-5)",,10.3389/fphar.2024.1451300,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2024.1451300,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2032226943&from=export,,"Copyright 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
The effects of acupuncture on patients with premature ovarian insufficiency and polycystic ovary syndrome: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses,"Bai T., Deng X., Bi J., Ni L., Li Z., Zhuo X.","Background: Previous studies have suggested that acupuncture could improve the clinical outcomes of women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However recent meta-analyses have provided inconclusive findings. This umbrella meta-analysis aimed to explore the effect of acupuncture therapies on PCOS and POI outcomes. Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out in in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Chinese databases, including Wan Fang Data Knowledge Service Platform, CBM, CNKI, and VIP up until April 2024 to gather relevant studies. Inclusion criteria were meta-analyses on the effect of acupuncture or combined therapies with standard medications or traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on PCOS and POI. The outcomes were pregnancy rates, ovulation rates, hormone levels, glycemic indices, resumption of menstruation, endometrial thickness, live birth rates, abortion rates, and body mass index (BMI). Studies with irrelevant interventions, animal studies, reviews without quantitative analysis, and studies with insufficient data were excluded. Standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and relative risk (RR) with a 95% CI were used as effect sizes to pool the data using a random effects model. Results: A total of 38 meta-analyses, 20 studies (sample size: 27,106 patients) for PCOS and 18 studies (sample size: 19,098 patients) for POI, were included. Overall, in women with PCOS, acupuncture therapies were significantly associated with a higher pregnancy rate, ovulation rate, and reduced serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, LH/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), insulin resistance, and BMI. Moreover, FSH, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin levels were improved in subgroup analyses. For POI, acupuncture significantly improved serum levels of LH, FSH, LH/FSH ratio, and estradiol. Conclusion: Acupuncture-related therapies improve pregnancy rate, and metabolic and hormonal imbalances in patients with POI and PCOS.

Machine learning classification of polycystic ovary syndrome based on radial pulse wave analysis,"Lim J., Li J., Feng X., Feng L., Xia Y., Xiao X., Wang Y., Xu Z.","Background: Patients with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) experienced endocrine disorders that may present vascular function changes. This study aimed to classify and predict PCOS by radial pulse wave parameters using machine learning (ML) methods and to provide evidence for objectifying pulse diagnosis in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Methods: A case-control study with 459 subjects divided into a PCOS group and a healthy (non-PCOS) group. The pulse wave parameters were measured and analyzed between the two groups. Seven supervised ML classification models were applied, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Voting, and Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM). Parameters that were significantly different were selected as input features and stratified k-fold cross-validations training was applied to the models. Results: There were 316 subjects in the PCOS group and 143 subjects in the healthy group. Compared to the healthy group, the pulse wave parameters h3/h1 and w/t from both left and right sides were increased while h4, t4, t, As, h4/h1 from both sides and right t1 were decreased in the PCOS group (P < 0.01). Among the ML models evaluated, both the Voting and LSTM with ensemble learning capabilities, demonstrated competitive performance. These models achieved the highest results across all evaluation metrics. Specifically, they both attained a testing accuracy of 72.174% and an F1 score of 0.818, their respective AUC values were 0.715 for the Voting and 0.722 for the LSTM. Conclusion: Radial pulse wave signal could identify most PCOS patients accurately (with a good F1 score) and is valuable for early detection and monitoring of PCOS with acceptable overall accuracy. This technique can stimulate the development of individualized PCOS risk assessment using mobile detection technology, furthermore, gives physicians an intuitive understanding of the objective pulse diagnosis of TCM.

Machine learning-based evaluation of application value of traditional Chinese medicine clinical index and pulse wave parameters in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome,"Lim J., Li J., Feng X., Feng L., Xiao X., Xia Y., Wang Y., Qian L., Yang H., Xu Z.","Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine disorder in women that often leads to ovulatory infertility. This study aims to establish and validate an effective predictive model for PCOS and to explore the correlation of features between patients with irregular menstruation and those with PCOS, using pulse wave parameters and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical indices. Methods: From August 2018 to January 2022, women with irregular menstruation were enrolled in this study. Subjects who met the inclusion criteria were categorized into PCOS and non-PCOS groups based on diagnostic criteria. Pulse wave parameters and TCM clinical indices were collected by two medical professionals. After data cleaning, recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) was used for feature selection. Four supervised machine learning classifiers were used to build PCOS prediction models, including Extra Trees (ET), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB/XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values based on the optimal model were visualized for further feature explanation. Results: A total of 450 women with irregular periods were enrolled in the study, consisting of 294 patients with PCOS and 156 without PCOS. Based on RFECV, 31 features, including 12 pulse parameters and 19 TCM clinical indices, were selected for building prediction models. Using pulse and TCM clinical index was superior to using pulse parameters or TCM clinical index alone in prediction. SVM achieved the best PCOS prediction results (accuracy=0.837, AUC=0.878, F1 score=0.878). For pulse parameters, lower values of right As, right h4, left h1, left h3, left h5, left w/t, and higher right t5 showed an obvious positive PCOS predictive effect. Women with PCOS were more likely to experience delayed menstruation, negative emotions, a slightly jelly-like menstrual texture, higher BMI, and a TCM assessment of greasy tongue coating. Conclusion: A PCOS prediction model based on the SVM algorithm was established and verified as the best model for distinguishing between patients with PCOS and patients without PCOS with irregular menstruation. The new prediction model that uses pulse wave parameters and TCM clinical indices offers a non-invasive and cost-effective way to diagnose PCOS, and the model provides objective evidence for TCM diagnosis.",,,10.1016/j.eujim.2023.102311,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2023.102311,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2028218423&from=export,,"Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

"Transcriptomic analysis reveals that the anti-PCOS effects of Zishen Qingre Lishi Huayu recipe may involve pathways and genes related to autophagy, steroidogenesis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in granulosa cells","Liang R., Sheng M., Li X., Jin J., Yi Y.","Ethnopharmacological relevance: Zishen Qingre Lishi Huayu recipe (ZQLHR) is a Chinese medicine compound composed of nine herbs for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is used to nourish kidneys, clear heat, reduce dampness and dissipation blood stasis by promoting diuresis and blood circulation, dredging the meridians and harmonizing menstruation in the treatment of PCOS. Several clinical studies have shown that ZQLHR is effective in the treatment of PCOS, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Aim of the study: In this study, we researched on the effects and mechanism of action of ZQLHR during treatment of human granulosa cells (hGCs) obtained from PCOS patients in order to provide a scientific basis for the clinical application of ZQLHR in the treatment of PCOS, emphasize the importance of some genes that have been reported to play a role in the pathogenesis or therapeutic mechanisms of PCOS from the perspective of disease treatment, and identify some new genes and signaling pathways that may play an important role in the treatment of PCOS. Materials and methods: KGN cells (a granulosa cell-like tumor cell line) were subjected to a cell counting kit-8 assay to explore the appropriate intervention concentration and duration of ZQLHR. Treated with or without ZQLHR (ZQLHR and control groups), the hGCs obtained from PCOS patients were sequenced using RNA sequencing, and the genes thus detected were further analyzed through Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and individuation gene analysis. These genes were also compared with PCOS-related genes in other databases. To further verify the authenticity of the differentially expressed genes between the two groups, the expression of eight randomly selected vital genes and three proteins of interest was verified through real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot experiment respectively. Results: The best intervention concentration and duration for ZQLHR to promote the proliferation of KGN cells were 0.2% and 48 h respectively in this experiment. Multiple signaling pathways and 55 focus differentially expressed genes, both related to autophagy, steroidogenesis, oxidative stress-related longevity, inflammation, and complications of PCOS, may play an important role in the therapeutic mechanism of action of ZQLHR. The expression of eight genes is consistent with the result of RNA sequencing, and the expression of three proteins of interest is the same as expected. Conclusions: The promotion of hGCs proliferation upon treatment with ZQLHR may be a manifestation of ZQLHR in the treatment of PCOS patients. The positive effects of ZQLHR against PCOS may involve pathways and genes related to autophagy, steroidogenesis, oxidative stress-related longevity, and inflammation in hGCs. Some components of ZQLHR applied for the treatment of PCOS may also be effective for the treatment of some complications of PCOS.","carbon dioxide (124-38-9, 58561-67-4), chorionic gonadotropin (9002-61-3), estradiol (50-28-2), follitropin (9002-68-0), insulin receptor substrate 2 (223747-03-3), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), Muellerian inhibiting factor (80497-65-0), prolactin (12585-34-1, 50647-00-2, 9002-62-4), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.1016/j.jep.2023.116551,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2023.116551,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2024466652&from=export,,"Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Effect of Licorice Root Powder on Parameters of Metabolic Syndrome Related to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,,"Brief SummaryThe goal of this study is to learn about the effect of licorice root powder on parameters of metabolic syndrome in those women diagnosed with PCOS with age range of 15-49 years of age. The study aims to answer the following questions: * Will licorice root powder consumption will have an impact on parameters of metabolic syndrome which are HDL levels, triglycerides, fasting blood pressure and blood glucose levels and abdominal obesity related to PCOS. * Will licorice help in lowering stress scores and improve quality of life. Females with diagnosed PCOS will be recruited in the study and will be randomly allotted to two groups. One group will be intervention group and second will be control group. Participants in intervention group will be given 1000mg of licorice root powder in form of capsules (1 per day). Control group will not take anything. For both groups, SF-12 health survey, and readings of lipid profile, fasting blood glucose and blood pressure and central obesity will be taken. Researcher will compare readings of both groups at baseline and after 3 months of intervention to assess the effect of licorice root powder.Detailed DescriptionPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder which is characterized by ovarian cyst, irregular menses and elevated androgen levels whereas metabolic syndrome (metS) includes presence of 3 out of 5 conditions which are abdominal obesity, high blood glucose levels, high blood pressure, high triglyceride levels and low HDL levels. Metabolic syndrome and polycystic ovary syndrome have a two-way relationship. The risk of development of metS in PCOS females is five-fold higher than non-PCOS females. If PCOS is not addressed timely then it can lead to infertility. Herbal treatments and ayurvedic medicine is thought to be effective in treating PCOS. A lot of data is available which shows positive results using herbs like cinnamon, aloevera etc but data on licorice root powder is limited. Licorice is one of the oldest herb and has anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antiobesity, hypolipidemic and so many other properties which makes it very useful herb. The objective of this study is to evaluate antidiabetic, hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory properties of licorice root powder on metabolic syndrome related to PCOS. The study will also observe effect of licorice on stress levels using SF-12 questionnaire. The study will be conducted in seven steps. Step 1 is the preparation of licorice root powder capsules. Step 2 is recruitment of participants. Participants will be recruited from universities and hospitals after checking their ultrasound report or diagnosis of PCOS by doctor. Step 3 is dividing the participants into two groups which are control and intervention group based on randomization. Step 4 is conduction of baseline testing of both groups of abdominal obesity, TGL, HDL, BGL, BP and stress levels. Step 5 is administration of capsules for 3 months.

Quercetin as a noteworthy treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome: An evidence-based review from molecular basis mechanism to clinical perspective,"Habiburrahman M., Wardoyo M.P., Putra A.B., Surya I.U., Pratama G.","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrinopathy that often occurs in reproductive-age women and causes anovulatory infertility problems. Current management guidelines, including fertility medications, hormonal therapy, and glycemic control, have drawbacks due to their limited efficacy and undesirable outcomes. Therefore, this review intended to scrutinise the mechanism and potential benefits of a candidate herbal therapy for PCOS, quercetin, as an adjunctive medication to alleviate disease manifestations. Articles were searched in PubMed, EBSCOHost, ProQuest, and Scopus databases and screened based on their titles and abstracts. A critical appraisal was done using an Evidence-Based Medicine worksheet. Fourteen eligible articles were obtained, including one systematic review, four randomized clinical trials; eight experimental studies; and one systematic pharmacological strategy-based research. It was shown that quercetin alleviated insulin resistance via activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3?“K) signalling, reduced testosterone, controlled luteinising hormone, and had anti-inflammatory effects on the ovaries. This antioxidant also altered catabolism and steroidogenesis, regulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and decreased oocyte nucleation failure. Furthermore, the lipid profile was reduced by quercetin through the modulation of adiponectin receptors. Ultimately, quercetin successfully improved the pregnancy rate. Due to its potential to modulate several pathways involved in metabolic disease and infertility, quercetin is a promising candidate in clinical practice as adjunctive therapy for PCOS.","clomifene citrate (50-41-9), corn oil (8001-30-7), hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase (172522-01-9, 72060-32-3), letrozole (112809-51-5), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (115926-52-8), prasterone (53-43-0), quercetin (117-39-5), resveratrol (501-36-0), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.1016/j.obmed.2023.100490,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.obmed.2023.100490,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2023677190&from=export,,"Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Effect of Qigongwan on Quality of Oocytes and Embryonic Development Potential in Patients with PCOS Infertility with Phlegm-dampness Syndrome,"Pan J., Liu P., Liu J., Yu X., Zhang J.","Objective: To observe the regulation of Qigongwan on the expression of proliferation and apoptosis-related factors programmed cell death 4(PDCD4)and proliferating cell nuclear antigen(PCNA)in ovarian granulosa cells(GCs)in patients with polycystie ovarian syndrome(PCOS)infertility with phlegm-dampness syndrome, and to explore the effect of Qigongwan on the quality of oocytes and embryonic development potential. Method:Sixty-six patients with PCOS with phlegm-dampness syndrome who underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer(IVF-ET)were randomly selected and divided into an observation group(Qigongwan + western medicine)and a control group(western medicine), with 33 patients in each group. Antagonist regimen was used to promote ovulation in the two groups. The observation group was given Qigongwan one cycle before IVF based on the treatment of conventional western medicine, while the control group was not given Chinese medicine. The improvement of phlegm and dampness syndrome, the dosage and the number of days of using gonadotropins(Gn), the levels of luteinizing hormone(LH), estradiol(E(2)), and progesterone(P)on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin(HCG)injection, the 2PN fertilization rate, and the high-quality embryo rate of patients in the two groups were compared. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (Real-time PCR)and Western blot technology were used to detect the expression of PCNA and PDCD4 in GCs. Result: As compared with groups before treatment, the score of phlegm-dampness syndrome in both groups was significantly lower(P<0.01). The score of phlegm and dampness syndrome in the observation group was significantly lower than that of the control group(P<0.01). As compared with the control group, the levels of LH, E(2), and P in the observation group was higher, but only the difference in the level of E(2) was statistically significant(P<0.01). The 2PN fertilization rate[82.25%(556/676)vs 69.92%(365/522),?(2)=25.172, P<0.01]and high-quality embryo rate[44.19%(190/430)vs 34.23%(102/298),?(2)=7.266, P<0.01]in the observation group were significantly higher than that of the control group(P<0.01). As compared with the control group, the mRNA and protein expression of PDCD4 in ovarian GCs was down-regulated in the observation group and that of PCNA was up-regulated(P<0.05). Conclusion: By down-regulating the expression of PDCD4 and up-regulating the expression of PCNA, Qigongwan may interfere with follicle development, adjust hormone levels, improve the symptomatic manifestations of patients with PCOS with phlegm-dampness syndrome, inhibit the apoptosis of GCs, and promote growth, thus improving the quality of oocytes and embryonic development potential.","chorionic gonadotropin (9002-61-3), estradiol (50-28-2), gonadotropin (63231-54-9), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), progesterone (57-83-0), protein (67254-75-5)",,10.13422/j.cnki.syfjx.20231591,http://dx.doi.org/10.13422/j.cnki.syfjx.20231591,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2025390125&from=export,,"Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

PCOS is not a simple gynecological or dermatological problem but a multisystem disorder with comorbidities. Patients mostly have anovulation presented as oligomennorhea or amenorrhea and hyperandrogenism presented with symptoms of hirsutism along with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. The presence of multiple cysts in the ovaries however, is not essential for diagnosis (2). Hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance being the key triggering condition apart from cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and obesity. PCOS and infertility involves genetic and environmental factors, however, in Pakistani the cultural background of intermarriages is contributing noticeably towards the multiplicity of disease (3). World Health Organization (WHO) has considered infertility as public health problem. It was the objective of UN conference 2015 to provide access and quality reproductive health services to all individuals. Management of PCOS require prolong use of pharmaceuticals which has serious effects sometimes even fatal, therefore the natural, easily available, cost effective nutraceuticals has tremendous effects and have now used safely in many clinical trials(4) The current study aims to provide evidence to support the use of neutraceuticals in the management of PCOS in infertile patients and their comparison with standard drug used in treatment of infertility caused by PCOS.. This study can help run a long way in achieving the millennium goals MDG(3) SGD(3) to which Pakistan is a signatory and to reduce maternal mortality and improve reproductive health of its female population The following agent is used as standard drug in an infertile women with PCOS in a clinical set-up Metformin a biguanide, used as first line drug for the treatment of diabetes and PCOS. It works by preventing hepatic gluconeogenesis and intestinal glucose absorption thus improving insulin sensitivity (5). In addition to its systemic effects on insulin signaling it effect autocrine/paracrine signaling in ovarian tissue thus improving ovarian steriodogensis and endometrial receptivity (6). In a recent study its role in infertile PCOS women was established resulting in significant number of ovulation and live birth than controls (7). Complementary and alternative medicine approach for the treatment of PCOS is becoming popular in recent years. It is claimed that dietary supplements and herbal remedies are safer than conventional drugs. Acetyl L-Carnitine : Carnitine a quaternary ammonium compound made in the body from lysine and methionine and is available in an active ( L) and an inactive (D ) form. L-carnitine is available in supplemental form and has significant role in enhancing metabolism, producing energy and protecting against oxidative stress. Role of carnitine in treating insulin resistance is being frequently discussed with reference to accrual of acyl-CoA derivatives (8). Hence as suggested if the normal levels of carnitine in the diabetics and obese patients is ensured the insulin insensitivity can be drastically improved. Further the level of L-carnitine in PCOS patients was found to be considerably less. Follicogensis is a highly energy dependent process on mitochondria. In PCOS the functioning of mitochondria is effected due to inflammation and other deregulations because of accumulation of testosterone and insulin in ovary. It help in transport of lipids from cytosol to mitochondria in breakdown of lipids for production of energy (9) Inositol; Inositols present in plants and animal a member of sugar alcohol comprising nine cyclohexane-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6-hexol stereoisomers. Being vitamin like it is made in human body as well as synthetically. It is a component of cell membrane and acts as a second messenger, has important role in release of different autacoids, hormones, and neurotransmitters (10).The promising role of two of its isomers namely Myo-inositol (MI) and D-chiro-inositol (DCI) in the treatment of PCOS has been documented. Studies have demonstrated that performance of MI to induce ovulation in patients with infertility due to PCOS can be improved if DCI is combined to it. Best results are achieved when the two isomers are used in 40:1 ratio which is the normal amount in which they exist in the body (11). Both MI and DCI can influence oxidative and non-oxidative metabolism. Apart from being involved in activation of multiple enzymes MI is involved in glucose transport and DCI in insulin production from B- cells and ATP production (12) DCI contributes in mediating insulin activity mainly on non-ovarian tissues, MI displays specific effects on ovary, chiefly by modulating glucose metabolism and FSH-signaling. Moreover, MI may also improve ovarian functions by modulating steroid metabolism through non-insulin-dependent pathways In PCOS patient due IR there is dysregulation in MI/DCI ratio in non- ovarian tissue related to reduced epimarse activity. However ovaries being insulin sensitive have lower level of MI than DCI due to increase epimerase activity (13). Rationale The incidence of PCOS is increasing throughout the world. It is much higher in Pakistani women (52%) than Caucasian women (20-25%) and is contributing towards both primary (50%) and secondary (25%) infertility (14). Infertilty has its sociocultural connotations resulting in emotional and mental stress. Infertilty due to PCOS should be treated with nutraceuticals for being natural, cost effective, easily available and with minimum side effects. The inositol isomers in its physiological ratio (40:1) and carnitine as an antioxidant has shown significant effects in regularization of metabolic and endocrine parameters of the body Rationale of the present study is that Inositol and Carnitine alone and in combination may be a better alternate for treatment of infertility in patients with PCOS, compared to Metformin. To the best of our knowledge no study till date is documented for synergistic effects of Acetyl-L Carnitine and inositol isomers when used, in physiological balanced ratio, for infertilty Objectives 1. To compare the effects of Inositol isomers and Acetyl-LCarnitine ( alone and in combination) with Metformin on improving ovulation, pregnancy rate, restoring ovarian function, metabolic balance and perceived stress response in patient with PCOS Hypothesis It is hypothesized that Inositol and Acetyl L-Carnitine alone may produce better or at least comparable results to Metformin in improving Pregnancy rate, ovulation, restoring ovarian function, metabolic balance and perceived stress response in infertile patients with PCOS. It is also hypothesized that the synergistic action of Inositol isomers and Acetyl L-Carnitine in combination may produce better or at least comparable results to Metformin in improving pregnancy rate, ovulation, restoring ovarian function, metabolic balance and perceived stress response in infertile patients with PCOS STUDY DESIGN: This will be a noncommercial randomized double blind clinical trial (RCT) in which subject and treatment provider will blinded to treatment intervention. In this study we will compare the treatment of naturally occurring nutraceuticals with Metformin (control group) which is used as first line drug in treatment of PCOS for infertile women.

Effects of Yulin Tong Bu formula on modulating gut microbiota and fecal metabolite interactions in mice with polycystic ovary syndrome,"Su Y.-N., Wang M.-J., Yang J.-P., Wu X.-L., Xia M., Bao M.-H., Ding Y.-B., Feng Q., Fu L.-J.","Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovarian dysfunction and polycystic ovarian morphology. Gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolite are associated with PCOS clinical parameters. Yulin Tong Bu formula (YLTB), a traditional Chinese medicine formula, has been recently indicated to be capable of ameliorating polycystic ovary symptoms and correcting abnormal glucose metabolism. However, the therapeutic mechanism of YLTB on PCOS has not been fully elucidated. Methods: A pseudo sterile mouse model was established during this four-day acclimatization phase by giving the animals an antibiotic cocktail to remove the gut microbiota. Here, the therapeutic effects of YLTB on PCOS were investigated using dehydroepiandrosterone plus high-fat diet-induced PCOS mice model. Female prepuberal mice were randomly divided into three groups; namely, the control group, PCOS group and YLTB (38.68 gÂ·kg(-1)Â·day(-1)) group. To test whether this effect is associated with the gut microbiota, we performed 16S rRNA sequencing studies to analyze the fecal microbiota of mice. The relationships among metabolites, gut microbiota, and PCOS phenotypes were further explored by using Spearman correlation analysis. Then, the effect of metabolite ferulic acid was then validated in PCOS mice. Results: Our results showed that YLTB treatment ameliorated PCOS features (ovarian dysfunction, delayed glucose clearance, decreased insulin sensitivity, deregulation of glucolipid metabolism and hormones, etc.) and significantly attenuated PCOS gut microbiota dysbiosis. Spearman correlation analysis showed that metabolites such as ferulic acid and folic acid are negatively correlated with PCOS clinical parameters. The effect of ferulic acid was similar to that of YLTB. In addition, the bacterial species such as Bacteroides dorei and Bacteroides fragilis were found to be positively related to PCOS clinical parameters, using the association study analysis. Conclusion: These results suggest that YLTB treatment systematically regulates the interaction between the gut microbiota and the associated metabolites to ameliorate PCOS, providing a solid theoretical basis for further validation of YLTB effect on human PCOS trials.","apocynin (498-02-2), benzothiazole (95-16-9), berberine (2086-83-1, 633-65-8), choline (123-41-1, 13232-47-8, 1927-06-6, 4858-96-2, 62-49-7, 67-48-1), citric acid (126-44-3, 5949-29-1, 77-92-9, 8002-14-0), cortisone (53-06-5), ferulic acid (1135-24-6, 24276-84-4), folic acid (59-30-3, 6484-89-5), follitropin (9002-68-0), gallocatechin (970-73-0), gluconic acid (133-42-6, 526-95-4, 66664-08-2), hydrocortisone (50-23-7), liquiritigenin (578-86-9), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9), metronidazole (39322-38-8, 443-48-1, 69198-10-3), neomycin (11004-65-2, 1404-04-2, 1405-10-3, 8026-22-0), pelargonidin (134-04-3), phytomenadione (11104-38-4, 84-80-0), prasterone (53-43-0), pyroglutamic acid (16891-48-8, 28874-51-3, 98-79-3), quercetin (117-39-5)",,10.3389/fendo.2023.1122709,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2023.1122709,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2021680688&from=export,,"Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Chinese herbal medicine alleviates the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome by improving oxidative stress and glucose metabolism via mitochondrial Sirtuin 3 signaling,"Zhang Q., Ren J., Wang F., Li M., Pan M., Zhang H., Qu F.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders among women, and the curative effects of its current management are not satisfactory. A formula of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), called Bu-Shen-Tian-Jing Formula (BSTJF), has clinically shown beneficial effects in treating PCOS. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying BSTJF for treatment of PCOS. Methods: Whole blood samples were collected from women with PCOS treated and not treated with BSTJF (n = 5 per group). Whole transcriptome sequencing of leukocytes and untargeted metabonomic analysis of the plasma were performed. Three groups of 18 female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly selected: control, PCOS, and BSTJF. A PCOS rat model was established using testosterone propionate. The estrous cycle; glucose tolerance; ovarian morphology; serum markers of oxidative stress; and expression of Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospho-protein kinase B in the ovary were measured. Palmitate was initially applied to KGN cells, followed by freeze-dried BSTJF powder. The glucose uptake, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and protein levels of SIRT3, PI3K, and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) were detected in KGN cells. Results: The transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles showed alterations in 572 genes and 73 metabolites in women with PCOS treated with BSTJF. The enriched pathways in women with PCOS treated with BSTJF were mainly involved in inflammation, insulin resistance, glucose and lipid metabolism, and neuro and associated signaling pathways. In PCOS rat models, BSTJF improved the estrous cycle, glucose tolerance, and ovarian morphology; relieved oxidative stress; increased ovarian SIRT3 expression; inhibited p38 MAPK activation; and promoted the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling in the ovary. In the in-vitro study with KGN cells, BSTJF rescued the palmitate-induced impaired glucose uptake and SIRT3 expression, reduced mitochondrial ROS production mediated by SIRT3, and restored the impaired insulin-induced PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Conclusion: BSTJF effectively alleviated the pathogenesis of PCOS by improving oxidative stress and glucose metabolism via mitochondrial SIRT3 and the following insulin signaling pathway.

A novel herbal combination ameliorates ovarian dysfunction and regulates altered biochemical parameters in rats with letrozole-induced polycystic ovary syndrome,"Shailajan S., Menon S., Singh S., Patil Y.","Objective: To investigate the potential activity of novel herbal combination and novel herbal formulation (syrup) in female Sprague Dawley rats with letrozole-induced polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods: Forty-two rats were randomly divided into seven groups with six rats in each group. Group 1 received 0.5% carboxy methylcellulose orally for 37 days and served as the normal control group. Group 2 was orally administered with letrozole of 1 mg/kg for 21 days and served as the PCOS induction group without treatment. Group 3 to 7 were administered with letrozole of 1 mg/kg for 21 days orally to induce PCOS, and then respectively received clomiphene citrate at 1 mg/kg, 100 and 200 mg/kg of novel herbal combination, 200 mg/kg of novel herbal formulation (syrup), and 400 mg/kg of marketed formulation of Pushyanuga churna, once daily for 15 days. Effects of the novel herbal combination and its syrup formulation were evaluated on the hormonal profile, the levels of antioxidants, the lipid profile and on the ovarian morphology, using letrozole-induced PCOS model in rats. Results: Letrozole caused alterations in hormonal levels and lipid levels similar to PCOS and ovarian histology showed presence of ovarian cysts confirming the induction of PCOS in rats. On treatment with the novel herbal combination and its syrup formulation in PCOS-induced rats, the altered hormonal and lipid profiles showed significant recovery to normal levels. Ovarian histology confirmed the restoration of folliculogenesis in the PCOS-induced rats. The treatment with the syrup formulation of novel herbal combination was found to be more effective than novel herbal combination and showed better recovery in various parameters evaluated. The results of the study, however, suggested that treatment with novel herbal combination and its syrup formulation provided minimal protection against oxidative stress caused due to the induction of PCOS. Conclusions: The integrated approach for management of PCOS is to counterbalance the limitations associated with modern therapy. Both the novel herbal combination and the syrup formulation of novel herbal combination show efficacy in the management of PCOS in rats and restore folliculogenesis in the ovary. The syrup formulation of novel herbal combination is most effective in the management of PCOS and shows potential to be developed as an adjuvant therapeutic agent.","carboxymethylcellulose (8050-38-2, 9000-11-7, 9004-32-4, 9050-04-8), catalase (9001-05-2), cholesterol (57-88-5), clomifene citrate (50-41-9), estradiol (50-28-2), follitropin (9002-68-0), glucose (50-99-7, 84778-64-3, 8027-56-3), glutathione peroxidase (9013-66-5), glutathione transferase (50812-37-8), letrozole (112809-51-5), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), progesterone (57-83-0), superoxide dismutase (37294-21-6, 9016-01-7, 9054-89-1), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.4103/2305-0500.365229,http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/2305-0500.365229,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2022471757&from=export,,"Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

We aimed to investigate effect of the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Rubus chingii Hu (R. chingii) on ovarian function and insulin resistance (IR) of PCOS rat models, and to explore the underlying mechanisms Methods: A PCOS rat model was established by subcutaneous injection of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) solution for 20 days. PCOS rats were randomly divided into a control group (CON), model group (MOD), metformin group (MET), TCM R. chingii group (RCG), and RCG + Ad-TXNIP groups. After 28 days of treatment, the samples were collected for subsequent experiments. Results: R. chingii treatment alleviated hormone imbalance and IR while improving ovarian pathology in the PCOS model. R. chingi inhibited the activation of the thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)/NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in the ovarian tissue of PCOS rats. Furthermore, TXNIP overexpression hindered the protective effect of R. chingii intervention in PCOS rats, as evidenced by the increase of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and atretic follicles. Conclusion: R. chingii intervention improved ovarian polycystic development by suppressing the TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome, which may be an effective treatment for PCOS.","C reactive protein (9007-41-4), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.1080/09513590.2023.2237116,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09513590.2023.2237116,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2024620145&from=export,,"Copyright 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Comparative effectiveness of aerobic exercise versus Yi Jin Jing on ovarian function in young overweight/obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Zhao J., Ketlhoafetse A., Liu X., Cao Y.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common heterogeneous endocrine disease among women of childbearing age, characterized by androgen excess and ovarian dysfunction. Aerobic exercise is an important solution used to manage PCOS, due to its multiple benefits. Yi Jin Jing is an important component of traditional Chinese exercise (TCE), based on the root of traditional Chinese medicine theory (TCM), which focuses on keeping the body as a whole in a harmonious state. However, to date there is no literature on the benign effects of Yi Jin Jing on PCOS. The primary purpose of this protocol is to assess the effectiveness of aerobic exercise versus Yi Jin Jing, on the management of ovarian function in young overweight/obese women with PCOS. Methods: The study will conduct a controlled randomized, superiority trial with three-arm parallel groups, recruiting 90 women diagnosed with PCOS, ages between 18 and 35 years, with a body mass index (BMI) ??23 kg/m(2). Women will be randomly assigned to either control group (combined oral contraceptives) or one of the intervention groups (Yi Jin Jing group or aerobic exercise group) with an allocation rate of 1:1:1. After randomization, the intervention will be conducted within a 12-week period. The primary outcome would be anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level; the secondary outcomes would be biochemical profiles, ovarian volume, antral follicle count, BMI, menstrual frequency, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Outcome measures would be collected during baseline and end of treatment. Reporting of the study will follow the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) statement. Discussion: This proposed study will be the first randomized clinical trial to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of aerobic exercise versus Yi Jin Jing on the management of ovarian function in young overweight/obese women with PCOS.

Investigating the active components of Huatan Tongjing decoction for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome via network pharmacology,"Yu J., Fu Y., Zeng L., Zheng Y.","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disease in women, potentially causing ovarian infertility for women at gestational age. Huatan Tongjing Decoction is commonly used to treat PCOS; however, the involved molecular mechanism has not been fully understood. In this study, the active components of Huatan Tongjing Decoction and potentially targeted proteins were downloaded from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database. PCOS-related genes were accessed from Malacards database. STRING database was utilized to construct a protein?“protein interaction (PPI) network based on the PCOS-related genes and the predicted targets. Subsequently, the PPI network was subjected to Random walk with restart (RWR). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed on top 50 genes with the high affinity scores to the drug targets. Subsequently, based on the predicted drug components and targets, a component?“gene interaction network was constructed. Finally, the most central drug targets were selected, and the corresponding compounds were subjected to molecular docking and dynamic simulations to examine their bindings. The 122 main active components and 246 potential targets of Huatan Tongjing Decoction were obtained from TCMSP, and a total of 259 nodes and 1919 interactions were acquired from the PPI network. The top 50 genes were mainly enriched in response to peptide hormone function and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Molecular docking and dynamic simulations predicted that MMP-quercetin interaction played an important role in the treatment of PCOS using Huatan Tongjing Decoction. Luteolin and quercetin in Huatan Tongjing Decoction potentially bound MMP9 and served as active components.

Bushen Jieyu Tiaochong Formula reduces apoptosis of granulosa cells via the PERK-ATF4-CHOP signaling pathway in a rat model of polycystic ovary syndrome with chronic stress,"Pan X., Liu Y., Liu L., Pang B., Sun Z., Guan S., Yan Q., Mo T., Chen R., Xu M., Chang Z., Zhou X.","Ethnopharmacological relevance: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common and complex endocrine disorder that is also an important cause of infertility. Adverse psychological stress can aggravate the occurrence and development of PCOS. Bushen Jieyu Tiaochong Formula (BJTF), a prescription of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has been used in the treatment of PCOS and shown to be effective in reducing negative emotion. However, the therapeutic mechanism has yet to be clearly elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the potential mechanism of action of BJTF. Aim of the study: To investigate the role of PERK-ATF4-CHOP signaling in the molecular mechanisms that mediate the effects of BJTF in a rat model of PCOS, with chronic stress induced by letrozole and a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) paradigm. Materials and methods: In addition to the normal control group, the PCOS combined with CUMS model rats were randomly assigned to a model group, a Diane-35 (ethinylestradiol 35 Î¼g/cyproterone acetate 2 mg)-treated positive control group, or one of three BJTF-treated groups receiving a low, medium, or high dose. Behavioral testing, including the sucrose preference test and open field test, was conducted, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to observe changes in the pathological morphology of ovarian tissue. Free testosterone (FT), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in serum were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The hippocampal levels of norepinephrine (NE), 5-hydroxytryptamine/serotonin (5-HT), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography?“electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Apoptotic granulosa cells were detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Furthermore, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and CHOP in the ovarian tissues. The expression levels of GRP78, CHOP, PERK, and ATF4 in ovarian tissues were also measured by western blotting. Results: Treatment with either BJTF or Diane-35 ameliorated the abnormal cystic dilatation of follicles in the model rats and reduced the serum levels of FT and LH, and the LH/FSH ratio. BJTF treatment also attenuated chronic psychological stress-like behavior and regulated the expression and metabolism of cerebral monoamine neurotransmitters. The efficacy of BJTF was greater than that of Diane-35, with the optimal effects observed at the medium dose. BJTF also lowered the apoptotic index of ovarian granulosa cells and downregulated the expression of GRP78, CHOP, and ATF4. Although the expression level of PERK was not significantly altered by BJTF, the mean PERK expression level was the lowest in the medium-dose BJTF group. Conclusions: Administration of BJTF has the therapeutic potential to promote the homeostasis of the reproductive endocrine environment and to restore follicular development and ovulation, possibly through the inhibition of the PERK-ATF4-CHOP signaling pathway, leading to downregulation of GRP78 expression to further delay ovarian granule cell apoptosis mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Moreover, BJTF could improve behavioral performance by regulating cerebral monoamine neurotransmitters in this rat model. These findings provide a new perspective for treating PCOS related to psychological stress using TCM.","5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid (1321-73-9, 54-16-0), cyproterone acetate plus ethinylestradiol (60528-19-0), eosin (17372-87-1, 51395-88-1, 548-26-5), follitropin (9002-68-0), hematoxylin (517-28-2), letrozole (112809-51-5), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), noradrenalin (1407-84-7, 51-41-2), protein kinase (9026-43-1), serotonin (50-67-9), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.1016/j.jep.2021.114923,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.114923,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2017504009&from=export,,"Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

The CAGs predominantly comprised of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus were more enriched, while the CAGs predominantly comprised of Bacteroides vulgatus, Alistipes, Blautia, Lachnospira, and Roseburia were more inhibited in the A group than in W group. Moreover, the CAGs enriched in the A group had a stronger negative correlation with the luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio, testosterone, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), Î±-1-acid glycoprotein (Î±-AGP), and leptin, and positive correlation with adiponectin and spexin, while the CAGs inhibited showed an opposite trend. Conclusions: High-fiber diet could alleviate the chronic metabolic inflammation, reproductive function, and brain?“gut peptides secretion of patients with PCOS, and high-fiber diet combined with acarbose could better improve the PCOS clinical phenotypes. The remodeling of gut microbiota by our intervention may play an important role in these improvements.

Effect of electroacupuncture combined with ginger-isolated moxibustion on endometrial receptivity in infertile patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome,"Lin Q.-P., Liu Y., Xu J.-B., Yang J., You X.-M., Zhang J.-X.","Objective: To observe the effect of the combined therapy of electroacupuncture (EA) and ginger-isolated moxibustion on endometrial receptivity in the patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Methods: A total of 70 subjects of PCOS were randomized into two groups, 35 cases in each one. In the western medication group, letrozole and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) were administered. In the combined therapy group, on the base of the treatment as the western medication group, the artificial cycle therapy with EA and ginger-isolated moxibustion was provided. The treatment duration was 3 menstrual cycles in two groups. After treated for 3 menstrual cycles, the symptom score of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), endometrial thickness, the number of ovulation cycle, endometrial morphology, bilateral uterine artery pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), the sum of peak systolic velocity/end diastolic velocity (S/D) and pregnancy were compared in the patients between two groups. Results: (1) After treatment, the endometrial thickness was better (0.21 Â± Â± 0.13 vs 0.14 Â± 0.08, P < 0.01), TCM symptom score reducing range was larger (5.00 Â± 2.24 vs 0.52 Â± 1.66, P < 0.01), the reducing degrees of bilateral uterine artery PI, RI and S/D sum were better (0.62 Â± 0.26 vs 0.04 Â± 0.15, 0.08 Â± 0.05 vs 0.01 Â± 0.05, 0.61 Â± 0.33 vs 0.07 Â± 0.17, 0.11 Â± 0.05 vs 0.01 Â± 0.05, 4.80 Â± 1.14 vs 0.15 Â± 0.89, all P < 0.01) in the combined therapy group respectively as compared with the western medication group. After treatment, the number of ovulation cycle and the proportion of A + B type of endometrial morphological were higher in the combined therapy group (2.09 Â± 0.78 vs 1.27 Â± 0.84, 87.5% vs 60.61%, P < 0.01, P < 0.05) as compared with the western medication group respectively. (2) The clinical pregnancy rate was 56.25% in the combined therapy group, better than 30.30% in the western medication group (P < 0.05). The early abortion rate was 10.53% in the combined therapy group, lower than 50.00% in the western medication group (P < 0.05).

Preventive online and offline health management intervention in polycystic ovary syndrome,"Liu R., Li M., Wang P., Yu M., Wang Z., Zhang G.-Z.","BACKGROUND Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinemia, ovarian polycystic changes, and irregular ovulation, often occurring in women of childbearing age for whom it can be a cause of infertility. Hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis dysregulation is important in the pathogenesis of PCOS and the associated chronic excess of sex hormones can lead to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, and malignancies such as endometrial cancer, and breast cancer. At present, most scholars agree that lifestyle interventions in conjunction with drug treatment can help PCOS patients achieve their goals of successful pregnancy and childbirth. AIM To investigate the clinical effect of an online and offline (O2O) preventive health management model on PCOS with kidney deficiency and phlegm dampness. METHODS A total of 82 patients with PCOS of the kidney deficiency and phlegm dampness type who were admitted to Beijing Luhe Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University from April 2019 to June 2020 were randomly divided into two groups. The treatment group was treated with oral Diane-35 for 3 mo and received preventive O2O medical health management for 6 mo (including eating and living, exercise, drug management). The control group was treated with oral Diane-35 for 3 mo and completed outpatient health education. The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome score, acne score, hair score, sex hormone level and clinical effects were compared between the two groups before and after the intervention. RESULTS After treatment, the TCM syndrome score, acne score, and serum luteinizing hormone/follicle stimulating hormone level were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (P < 0.05). After 3 mo of treatment, the TCM syndrome curative effect index in the treatment group was 97.30% compared to 54.05% in the control group (P < 0.05), whereas the total treatment effect in the treatment group was 91.89%, compared to 54.05% in the control group (P < 0.05).

Meta-analysis of therapeutic efficacy and effects of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine on coagulation and fibrinolysis system in patients with threatened abortion and polycystic ovary syndrome,"Chen X., Tao C., Wang J., He B., Xu J.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients are prone to early pregnancy loss. Studies have found that the blood fibrinolytic activity of PCOS patients is closely related to the high abortion rate. At present, it is considered that the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the treatment of PCOS with threatened abortion has a good effect on fetal protection. Therefore, the clinical efficacy of the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the treatment of PCOS with threatened abortion was systematically evaluated, and the effect of traditional Chinese medicine on the blood fibrinolytic status of patients was also evaluated. Methods: The clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the treatment of PCOS with threatened abortion were reviewed from four Chinese databases (CNKI, WANFANG, VIP, and SINOMED) and two English databases (PubMed, EMBASE) from their time of establishment to May 2021. According to the inclusive and exclusive criteria, tests were selected, data were extracted and evaluated, the systematic review was carried out by description analysis, and the meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 software from Cochrane Collaboration. Begg's and Egger's tests were performed for assessing symmetries of funnel plot by the software Stata 16.0. Results: 6 RCTs involving 361 participants were included. Meta-analysis results showed that integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine can increase the total efficacy compared with the control groups [RR=1.22, 95% CI (1.10, 1.35), P=0.0002]. Meanwhile, the improvement of TCM syndrome integral [MD=-2.11, 95% CI (-2.56, -1.66), P<0.00001], D-II [MD=-0.29, 95% CI (-0.49, -0.09), P=0.004], Hcy [MD=-3.02, 95% CI (-3.64, -2.39, P=0.00001], PAI-I [SMD=-2.38, 95% CI (-2.82, -1.73), P<0.00001] were better than a single Western medicine treatment. And it can increase the level of Î²-HCG [SMD=3.44, 95% CI (1.87, 5.01), P<0.0001], P [MD=7.70, 95% CI (7.10, 8.31), P<0.00001], E2 [MD=205.36, 95% CI (140.93, 269.80), P<0.00001]. The funnel plot, Egger's test (P=0.210), and Begge's test (P=0.573) suggested that there was no evidence of substantial publication bias. Conclusions: The effect of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine is better than that of Western medicine alone in the treatment of PCOS with threatened abortion, and it has certain advantages in improving the fibrinolytic status of patients. However, due to the limitation of the quality and quantity of the included literature, more rigorous and larger sample studies are needed to confirm these conclusions in the future.","blood clotting factor 10 (9001-29-0), estradiol (50-28-2), homocysteine (454-28-4, 6027-13-0), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (140208-23-7), progesterone (57-83-0)",,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2018697579&from=export,,"Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
The Efficacy of Chinese Herbal Medicine in Animal Models of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Zhang J., Xin X., Zhang H., Zhu Y., Ye Y., Li D.","Objective. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) on ovarian mass, weight, sex hormone disorders, and insulin resistance in animal models of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted through a comprehensive search in three databases to find studies testing CHM in animal models of PCOS. Two researchers independently reviewed the retrieval, extraction, and quality assessment of the dataset. The pooled effects were calculated using random-effect models; heterogeneity was explored through subgroup analysis; and stability was assessed through sensitivity analysis. In addition, publication bias was assessed using the Egger's bias test. Results. Fifteen studies with twelve mice and 463 rats published from 2016 to 2021 met the inclusion criteria. The results of primary outcomes revealed that CHM therapy was significantly different with control animals in ovarian mass and testosterone (SMD, -1.01 (95% CI, -1.58, -1.45); SMD, -1.62 (95% CI, -2.07, -1.16), respectively). The secondary outcomes as well showed an overall positive effect of CHM compared with control animals in weight (SMD, -1.02 (95% CI, -1.39, -0.65)), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (SMD, 0.58 (95% CI, 0.19, 0.97)), luteinizing hormone (LH) (SMD, -0.94 [95% CI, -1.25, -0.64)), homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (SMD, -1.24 (95% CI, -1.57, -0.92)). Subgroup analyses indicated that PCOS induction drug, formula composition, random allocation, and assessment of model establishment were relevant factors that influenced the effects of interventions. The stability of the meta-analysis was showed robust through sensitivity analysis. The publication bias was substantial. Conclusions. Administration with CHM revealed a statistically positive effect on ovarian mass, weight, sex hormone disorders, and insulin resistance. Moreover, these data call for further high-quality studies investigating the underlying mechanism in more depth.","letrozole (112809-51-5), prasterone (53-43-0), prasterone sulfate (651-48-9), testosterone (58-22-0), testosterone propionate (57-85-2)",,10.1155/2022/4892215,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/4892215,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2019924057&from=export,,"Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
The Efficacy and Safety of Dingkun Pill in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Jin B., Zhang Y., Zhang Z., Yang G., Pan Y., Xie L., Liu J., Shen W.","Objective. Dingkun Pill (DKP) is a proprietary Chinese medicine that has been utilized for patients with gynecological diseases, and its clinical application has been widely accepted in China. However, the effects of DKP on reproduction and metabolism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have never been systematically evaluated. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DKP in treating reproductive and metabolic abnormalities with PCOS. Methods. We searched in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, VIP Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database up until January 2022 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The methodological quality of the included RCTs was estimated using the Cochrane collaboration risk-of-bias instrument, and the meta-analysis was performed using RevMan. Results. A total of 22 RCTs (including 1994 participants) were identified. DKP, combined with ovulation-inducing drugs (OID) or combined oral contraceptives (COC) was superior to OID or COC alone in improving the pregnancy rate (relative risk (RR) 1.84, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.11 and RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.64, respectively), ovulation rate (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.84 and RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37, respectively), endometrial thickness (weighted mean difference (WMD) 2.50, 95% CI 1.91 to 3.09 and WMD 0.62, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.16, respectively), luteinizing hormone (WMD -1.93, 95% CI -2.80 to-.07 and WMD -1.79, 95% CI -2.66 to-0.92, respectively), and testosterone (standardized mean difference (SMD) -2.12, 95% CI -3.01 to-1.24 and SMD -1.21, 95% CI -1.64 to-0.78, respectively). DKP combined with COC led to a greater improvement in homeostasis model assessment-Î² (WMD 20.42, 95% CI 16.85 to 23.98) when compared with COC alone. There was a significant difference between DKP and COC in terms of decreasing total cholesterol (WMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.72 to-0.02), triacylglycerol (WMD -0.85, 95% CI -1.50 to-0.20), and free fatty acid (WMD -130.00, 95% CI -217.56 to-42.22). However, DKP did not affect the follicle stimulating hormone, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Adverse reactions were more common in COC alone compared to DKP and COC in combination (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.63). Conclusion. DKP shows promise in modifying reproductive and metabolic parameters in patients with PCOS and may be used as a primary choice in conventional or complementary therapies for PCOS. The quality of the evidence analyzed was suboptimal, and therefore, our results should be interpreted cautiously. More prospective large-scale and well-designed RCTs, as well as longer intervention durations are required in the future to draw more reliable conclusions.","alanine aminotransferase (9000-86-6, 9014-30-6), bilirubin glucuronide (27071-67-6), cholesterol (57-88-5), follitropin (9002-68-0), glucose (50-99-7, 84778-64-3), insulin (9004-10-8), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.1155/2022/8698755,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/8698755,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2020204050&from=export,,"Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

This investigation was conducted to analyze and evaluate the impact of Chinese herbal medicine on glucolipid metabolism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods. We used manual and computer-aided search methods, and the search scopes included Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, the China Science and Technology Journal Database, and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database) and English databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library). We searched these eight databases for randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of Chinese herbal medicine on glucolipid metabolism in women with PCOS, with the retrieval deadline being June 2021. Two reviewers screened, selected, and extracted data and verified the results independently. The NoteExpress software was used to manage and screen the literature, the risk of bias assessment tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies, and the RevMan 5.4 software was used for meta-analysis. Results. A total of 13 trials were included, including 825 patients with PCOS. Because the drugs used in the control group were different, we divided the results into two parts, with four trials using placebo and nine trials using metformin as the control. The results of the meta-analysis showed that fasting insulin (MD = -2.45, 95% CI = [-4.74, -0.17], P = 0.04), 2 h fasting plasma glucose (MD = -0.33, 95% CI = [-0.64, -0.02], P = 0.04), serum total cholesterol (MD = -0.38, 95% CI = [-0.58, -0.18], P = 0.0002), triglycerides (MD = -0.36, 95% CI = [-0.58, -0.14], P = 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD = -0.58, 95% CI = [-0.75, -0.41], P < 0.00001) were significantly improved in the Chinese herbal medicine group compared with the placebo group. In addition, compared with metformin, body mass index (MD = -1.04, 95% CI = [-1.55, -0.53], P < 0.0001), serum total cholesterol (MD = -0.27, 95% CI = [-0.46, -0.07] P = 0.007), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly reduced (MD = -0.12, 95% CI = [-0.22, -0.02], P = 0.02) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD = 0.09, 95% CI = [0.02, 0.17], P = 0.01) was significantly improved after treatment with Chinese herbal medicine. Conclusion. Compared with the placebo group, Chinese herbal medicine had positive effects on glucolipid metabolism in women with PCOS.

Add-on effect of the Guizhi Fuling formula for management of reduced fertility potential in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Rong A., Ta N., Lihua E., Meng W.","Background: Guizhi Fuling (GZFL) pill, a traditional Chinese herbal formula including Semen Persicae, Ramulus Cinnamomi, Poria, Radix Paeoniae Alba, and Cortex Moutan, has been widely applied in the management of gynecological diseases. Objective: To evaluate the add-on effect of the GZFL formula for treating reduced fertility potential in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Two reviewers independently searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang, SinoMed, and CKNI databases until 09/11/2022. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the GZFL formula plus Western medicine versus the Western medicine for treating PCOS. The primary endpoint was the ovulation, pregnancy, and miscarriage rate. The secondary endpoints included the serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Results: There were 16 RCTs with 1,385 patients identified. The GZFL formula plus Western medicine significantly improved the ovulation rate (risk ratios [RR] 1.24; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.15??.34) and pregnancy rate (RR 1.53; 95% CI 1.38 to 1.69) than the Western medicine alone. Adjuvant treatment with the GZFL formula also significantly decreased the serum FSH (mean difference [MD] -0.48 U/l; 95% CI -0.80 to -0.15), total testosterone (standard mean difference [SMD] -1.07; 95% CI -1.71 to -0.44), LH level (MD -2.19 U/l; 95% CI -3.04 to -1.34), and HOMA-IR (MD -0.47; 95% CI -0.60 to -0.34). However, there was no significant difference in the miscarriage rate (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.36??.20) and serum estradiol level (SMD 0.34; 95% CI -0.25 to 0.94) between two groups. Conclusions: The GZFL formula as adjuvant therapy can improve the ovulation and pregnancy rates in women with PCOS. Its beneficial effects may correlate with reducing FSH, total testosterone, and LH and ameliorating insulin resistance.

METHODS: The PubMed (2000 to August 2021), Excerpta Medica Database (2000 to August 2021), Chinese Biomedical Literature (2000 to August 2021), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (2000 to August 2021) databases were searched. All patients with PCOS were included in the randomized controlled study of Jinfeng pills combined with an adjuvant Western medicine treatment. After screening and a risk of bias assessment, Stata16.0 software was used for the analysis. RESULTS: A total 7 of articles (comprising 691 patients; 26-83 participants per group) were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that the effective rate the experimental group treated with Jinfeng pills combined with adjuvant Western medicine was higher than that of the control group treated with Western medicine only [relative risk (RR) =1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03 to 1.28; P=0.015].

Kuntai Capsule Combined With Letrozole on Gonadal Hormone Levels and Ovarian Function in Patients With PCOS: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Tang X., Huang Q., Wang C., Zhang D., Dong S., Yu C.","Background: The efficacy of Kuntai capsule combined with letrozole (LE) in improving ovarian function of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been evaluated before, but there is still a lack of evidence-based support for the regulation of sex hormone levels. In recent years, new randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been reported on the effect of combined therapy on regulating sex hormone levels. Objective: We aimed to systematically evaluate the efficacy of Kuntai capsule combined with LE in the treatment of PCOS. Methods: A search across the China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Wanfang database, PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, and Embase was conducted on Kuntai capsule combined with LE in the treatment of PCOS. The time of the self-built database was up to April 30, 2021. RCTs of LE in the control group and LE combined with Kuntai capsule in the experimental group were selected. RevMan5.3 software was used for data analysis. Results: A total of 17 studies were gathered, which included 1,684 patients. The meta-analysis results showed that the total effective rate of the combined group was 93.36% and that of the LE group was 78.15%. The improvement in the ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, number of mature follicles, endometrial thickness, cervical mucus score, and serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin (PRL) in the combined group was consistent with the results of a previous meta-analysis and was better than that in the LE group (p < 0.05). In addition, the combination group was better than the LE group in regulating the levels of estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) (p < 0.05). There were no adverse drug reactions in the two groups during treatment. Conclusion: As a type of pure traditional Chinese medicine preparation, Kuntai capsule combined with LE had a better effect than LE alone in the treatment of PCOS, with advantages mainly reflected in enhancing ovarian function and regulating the levels of sex hormones in vivo, among others, but the value of combined therapy still needs to be verified by more high-quality RCTs.","estradiol (50-28-2), letrozole (112809-51-5), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), prolactin (12585-34-1, 50647-00-2, 9002-62-4), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.3389/fendo.2021.789909,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2021.789909,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L636872424&from=export,,"Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Effectiveness of herb-partitioned moxibustion combined with electroacupuncture on polycystic ovary syndrome in patients with symptom pattern of kidney deficiency and phlegm-dampness,"Zhao Q., Sun Y., Zhou J., Gao Y., Ma G., Hu Z., Wang Y., Shi Y.","OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of herb-partitioned moxibustion combined with electroacupuncture on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in patients with symptom pattern of kidney deficiency and phlegm-dampness. METHODS: Totally 62 PCOS patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into intervention group and control group. In the intervention group, acupoints were subjected to (43 Â± 1) ??herb-partitioned moxibustion and electroacupuncture treatment. In the control group, acupoints were subjected to (37 Â± 1) ??herb-partitioned moxibustion and sham electroacupuncture treatment. Treatment was provided 3 times per week for 12 weeks, and the treatment was stopped during menstruation. After the treatment, the clinical efficacy, the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) symptom pattern score, basal body temperature (BBT) levels, menstrual cycle, and related sex hormone levels of the two groups were evaluated. RESULTS: Sixty patients were eventually included in the study (30 in the intervention group and 30 in the control group). There were not obvious between- group differences in the baseline efficacy parameters (all P > 0.05). (a) After treatment, the two groups have improved in terms of clinical efficacy, TCM symptom pattern score, menstrual cycle and, BBT (P < 0.01, < 0.05), and the intervention group was better than the control group (P < 0.01, < 0.05). (b) In the intervention group, the estradiol (E2) and P450 aromatase (P450arom) levels were increased (all P < 0.05), the testosterone (T) level was decreased (P < 0.05), and the luteotropic hormone (LH) and anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) levels were significantly decreased (P < 0.01). In the control group, E2 level was increased (P < 0.05), and LH level was decreased (P < 0.05). After treatment, the T, LH, and AMH levels of the intervention group were decreased compared with those of the control group (all P < 0.05), and the P450arom level was increased (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Herb-partitioned moxibustion combined with electroacupuncture can effectively improve the related clinical symptoms of PCOS patients with kidney deficiency and phlegm-dampness. Herb-partitioned moxibustion combined with electroacupuncture may inhibit the overexpression of AMH to increase the expression level of P450arom in ovarian granulosa cells, thereby reconstructing the dependence of follicular development on FSH, and finally improving abnormal follicular development and hyperandrogenism in PCOS patients with kidney deficiency and phlegmdampness.","aromatase (9039-48-9), cytochrome P450 (9035-51-2), estradiol (50-28-2), prolactin (12585-34-1, 50647-00-2, 9002-62-4), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.19852/j.cnki.jtcm.2021.06.017,http://dx.doi.org/10.19852/j.cnki.jtcm.2021.06.017,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2016403152&from=export,,"Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
"Effects of Tea Consumption on Anthropometric Parameters, Metabolic Indexes and Hormone Levels of Women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","Shen W., Pan Y., Jin B., Zhang Z., You T., Qu Y., Han M., Yuan X., Zhang Y.","Objective: Our aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness and safety of tea supplements for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods: We conducted searches of the published literature in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP database, and Wanfang Database in 1985 to September 2021. Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were obtained to assess the effects of tea versus placebo in women with PCOS. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) were pooled using a random-effects model or risks ratios (RRs) using a random-effects model. Results: Six RCTs (235 participants) were included in our systematic review. Tea supplements as adjuvant therapy led to greater improvement in body weight (WMD ??.71, 95% CI ??.95 to ??.46, P = 0.02, I(2) = 0%), fasting blood glucose (FBG: WMD ??.40, 95% CI ??.59 to ??.20, P < 0.0001, I(2) = 0%) and fasting insulin (FINS: WMD ??.40, 95% CI ??.76 to ??.03, P < 0.00001, I(2) = 0%) when compared with placebo. There were no significant differences of body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body fat rate, total testosterone, free testosterone (FT), dehydroepiandrosterone, luteinizing hormone or follicular-stimulating hormone (FSH) between the two groups. In addition, subgroup analysis suggested that green tea was effective on body weight, FINS, FBG, FT, and FSH, and herbal tea can also reduce FT levels, tea supplements had a significant impact on FBG and FSH in trials with intervention duration ??3 months, and intervention lasting less than 3 months can improve FINS. Tea had significant effect on reducing WHR, FBG and FSH in Asian PCOS patients, but not in Caucasians. And there was no statistically significant effect of tea on weight and FINS in Asians, but it was effective for Caucasian participants. Compared with placebo, tea supplements did not cause significant adverse reactions (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.30 to 6.90, P = 0.65, I(2) = 0%). Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that consumption of tea supplementation in women with PCOS could significantly decrease the levels of FBG and FINS as well as reduce body weight. Especially green tea, not only has the above effects, but also has a significant effect on improving a variety of reproductive hormone indexes. Furthermore, tea supplementation is a relatively safe therapy for PCOS patients.

The effect of lutein and Urtica dioica extract on in vitro production of embryo and oxidative status in polycystic ovary syndrome in a model of mice,"Bandariyan E., Mogheiseh A., Ahmadi A.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most prevalent endocrinopathies in women during the reproductive age. Herbal medicines are used increasingly alone or in supplement with chemical medicines for the treatment of different diseases and dysfunctions. This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of lutein and nettle (Urtica dioica) extract on the biochemical parameters and the reproductive function in the PCOS model of mice. Methods: Following the induction of PCOS by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), the mice (n = 98) were randomly assigned into seven groups, each consisting of fourteen mice; the groups were included control group (received solvent), PCOS group (received 6 mg/100 g B.W/day IP, DHEA for 21 days), PCOS+ Nettle extract (200 and 400 mg/kg), PCOS+ Lutein (125 and 250 mg/kg), and PCOS+ NL (200 mg/kg nettle extract and 125 mg/kg lutein). The nettle extract and lutein were administrated using gavage for 30 consecutive days after PCOS induction. Malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and estrogen were measured in serum, ovary, and uterus samples by the ELISA method. The total number of oocytes, oocyte quality, fertilization rate, 2-cell blastocyst, and arrested embryos (type I, type II, and type III) were also investigated. Results: A combination treatment of the nettle and lutein produced the lowest concentration of MDA in comparison to other groups which affected by the PCOS. The lowest level of TAC was observed in the PCOS group without treatment. The number of oocytes, oocyte quality, fertilization rate, and 2-cell blastocyst were significantly higher in the control group, but the lowest values were observed in the PCOS group without any treatment. Conclusions: The most favorable findings include improving antioxidant capacity, oocyte and embryo quality were observed in the PCOS+ 125 L group.","chorionic gonadotropin (9002-61-3), estradiol (50-28-2), ketamine (1867-66-9, 6740-88-1, 81771-21-3), malonaldehyde (542-78-9), prasterone (53-43-0), seric gonadotropin (9002-70-4), xanthophyll (127-40-2, 52842-48-5), xylazine (23076-35-9, 7361-61-7)",,10.1186/s12906-021-03229-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-021-03229-x,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2010433600&from=export,,"Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
"Efficacy of Bushen Huatan Decoction combined with Baduanjin in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome with insulin resistance (IR-PCOS), kidney deficiency and phlegm dampness: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Qian H., Xu W., Cui L., Wang R., Wang J., Tang M., Wei M., Wang L.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common reproductive endocrine disease in women. Insulin resistance (IR) has emerged as a central contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease. According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), kidney deficiency is the main syndrome of PCOS. The deficiency of the kidney cannot vaporize water-dampness, and the retention of water-dampness accumulates into phlegm dampness stagnation, resulting in visceral dysfunction and metabolic disorder. TCM involving syndrome differentiation and treatment is widely used to adjust women?™s menstrual cycles. Our patented formula Bushen Huatan Decoction (BSHTD) has been proven to be effective in the clinical treatment of IR-PCOS. Baduanjin also plays an important role in improving metabolic syndrome through lifestyle intervention. This study investigates the clinical efficacy of Bushen Huatan Decoction combined with Baduanjin in IR-PCOS, to form a specific TCM-behaviour intervention plan in the treatment of IR-PCOS. Methods/design: This is a randomized controlled trial involving 190 participants diagnosed with IR-PCOS. All participants will be randomly allocated into 5 groups: group A will receive metformin; group B, BSHTD; group C, Baduanjin; group D, BSHTD combined with metformin; and group E, BSHTD combined with Baduanjin. One course of treatment lasts 3 months, a total of two courses. The primary outcomes are changes in the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and improvements in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin-releasing test (INS). The secondary outcomes are improvements in the menstrual cycle, ovulation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, basic serum sex hormone levels, free androgen index (FAI), Ferriman-Gallwey scores, body mass index (BMI) and TCM syndrome scores. The related observation indexes will be collected at baseline, during the process of treatment and at the 6-month follow-up. Simultaneously, close monitoring of possible adverse events will be performed throughout the trial process. Discussion: This trial will investigate the efficacy of the comprehensive intervention program of Bushen Huatan Decoction combined with Baduanjin on the adjustment of the menstrual cycle, improvement of insulin resistance and correction of glucose metabolism disorder in IR-PCOS patients. It is expected to form an alternative treatment of TCM-behaviour intervention therapy for IR-PCOS and promote the Chinese fitness Qigong Baduanjin in the application of lifestyle diseases.

The effects of Chinese herbal medicine on the pregnancy outcomes of infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Liu C., Dai M., Zhao L., Wang F.","Background: At present, Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has already been widely used as an important adjuvant treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET). This systematic review and meta-analysis were designed to evaluate the effects of CHM on the pregnancy outcomes of infertile women with PCOS undergoing IVF-ET. Methods: We searched seven electronic databases systematically for published articles to January 2021. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CHM with blank or placebo for infertile PCOS patients undergoing IVF-ET were included. The measures of treatment effect were the pooled odds ratios (OR) of the clinical pregnancy rate, the abortion rate and the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) incidence. Results: This meta-analysis included 10 studies involving 663 patients comparing CHM with blank or placebo for infertile PCOS patients undergoing IVF-ET. The pooled data showed that CHM could improve the clinical pregnancy rate (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.73??.35, p < 0.01) and reduce the OHSS incidence (OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.18??.55, p < 0.01) of infertile PCOS patients with IVF-ET treatment. No significant difference in the abortion rate was found between the CHM and control groups (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.23??.81, p = 0.40).

Effect of berberine on cardiovascular disease risk factors: A mechanistic randomized controlled trial,"Zhao J.V., Yeung W.-F., Chan Y.-H., Vackova D., Leung J.Y.Y., Ip D.K.M., Zhao J., Ho W.-K., Tse H.-F., Schooling C.M.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Berberine, a long-standing, widely used, traditional Chinese medicine, is thought to have beneficial effects on CVD risk factors and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. The mechanisms and effects, specifically in men, possibly via testosterone, have not been examined previously. To assess the effect of berberine on CVD risk factors and any potential pathway via testosterone in men, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial in Hong Kong. In total, 84 eligible Chinese men with hyperlipidemia were randomized to berberine (500 mg orally, twice a day) or placebo for 12 weeks. CVD risk factors (lipids, thromboxane A2, blood pressure, body mass index and waist?“hip ratio) and testosterone were assessed at baseline, and 8 and 12 weeks after intervention. We compared changes in CVD risk factors and testosterone after 12 weeks of intervention using analysis of variance, and after 8 and 12 weeks using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Of the 84 men randomized, 80 men completed the trial. Men randomized to berberine had larger reductions in total cholesterol (??.39 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) ??.70 to ??.08) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (??.07 mmol/L, 95% CI ??.13 to ??.01) after 12 weeks. Considering changes after 8 and 12 weeks together, berberine lowered total cholesterol and possibly low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), and possibly increased testosterone. Changes in triglycerides, thromboxane A2, blood pressure, body mass index and waist?“hip ratio after the intervention did not differ between the berberine and placebo groups. No serious adverse event was reported. Berberine is a promising treatment for lowering cholesterol. Berberine did not lower testosterone but instead may increase testosterone in men, suggesting sex-specific effects of berberine. Exploring other pathways and assessing sex differences would be worthwhile, with relevance to drug repositioning and healthcare.","berberine (2086-83-1, 633-65-8), cholesterol (57-88-5), lipid (66455-18-3), testosterone (58-22-0), thromboxane A2 (57576-52-0)",,10.3390/nu13082550,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu13082550,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2013006405&from=export,,"Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Chinese herbal medicine for subfertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome,"Zhou K., Zhang J., Xu L., Lim C.E.D.","Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is characterised by both metabolic and reproductive disorders, and affects 5% to 15% of women of reproductive age. Different western medicines have been proposed for PCOS-related subfertility, such as oral contraceptives, insulin sensitisers and laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD). Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) have also been used for subfertility caused by PCOS for decades, and are expected to become an alternative treatment for subfertile women with PCOS. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for subfertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and six other databases, from inception to 2 June 2020. In addition, we searched three trials registries, the reference lists of included trials and contacted experts in the field to locate trials. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CHM versus placebo, no treatment or conventional (western) therapies for the treatment of subfertile women with PCOS. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in included studies and extracted data. We contacted primary study authors for additional information. We conducted meta-analyses. We used the odds ratios (ORs) to report dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods. Main results: We included eight RCTs with 609 participants. The comparisons in the included trials were as follows: CHM versus clomiphene, CHM plus clomiphene versus clomiphene (with or without ethinyloestradiol cyproterone acetate (EE/CPA)), CHM plus follicle aspiration plus ovulation induction versus follicle aspiration plus ovulation induction alone, and CHM plus laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) versus LOD alone. The overall certainty of the evidence for most comparisons was very low. None of the included studies reported the primary outcome, live birth rate. Most studies reported the secondary outcomes, and only one study reported data on adverse events. In trials that compared CHM to clomiphene (with or without LOD in both study arms), we are uncertain of the effect of CHM on pregnancy rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 3.19; I(2) = 28%; 3 studies, 140 participants; very low certainty evidence). Results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy following clomiphene is assumed to be 21.5%, the chance following CHM would vary between 14.7% and 46.7%. No study reported data on adverse events. When CHM plus clomiphene was compared to clomiphene (with or without EE/CPA), there was low certainty evidence of a higher pregnancy rate in the CHM plus clomiphene group (OR 3.06, 95% CI 2.05 to 4.55; I(2) = 10%; 6 studies, 470 participants; low certainty evidence). Results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy following clomiphene is assumed to be 31.5%, the chance following CHM plus clomiphene would vary between 48.5% and 67.7%.No data were reported on adverse events. In trials that compared CHM plus follicle aspiration and ovulation induction to follicle aspiration and ovulation induction alone, we are uncertain of the effect of CHM on pregnancy rates (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 5.68; 1 study, 44 women; very low certainty evidence). Results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy following follicle aspiration and ovulation induction is assumed to be 29.2%, the chance following CHM with follicle aspiration and ovulation induction would vary between 15.9% and 70%. Reported adverse events included severe luteinised unruptured follicle syndrome (LUFS) (Peto OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.06 to 6.14; 1 study, 44 women; very low certainty evidence), ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (Peto OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.00 to 8.19; 1 study, 44 women; very low certainty evidence) or multiple pregnancy (Peto OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.06 to 6.14; 1 study, 44 women; very low certainty evidence). These results suggest that if the chances of LUFS, OHSS, and multiple pregnancy following follicle aspiration and ovulation induction are assumed to be 8.3%, 4.2%, and 8.3% respectively, the chances following CHM with follicle aspiration and ovulation induction would be 0.5% to 35.8%, 0% to 26.3% and 0.5% to 35.8% respectively. In trials that compared CHM plus LOD to LOD alone, we are uncertain if CHM improves pregnancy rates (OR 3.50, 95% CI 0.72 to 17.09; 1 study, 30 women; very low certainty evidence). Results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy following LOD is assumed to be 40%, the chance following CHM with LOD would vary between 32.4% and 91.9%. No data were reported on adverse events. We are uncertain of the results in the comparison groups for all outcomes. The certainty of the evidence for all other comparisons and outcomes was very low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or adverse events, failure to describe study methods in adequate detail and imprecision due to very low event rates and wide CIs. Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of CHM for subfertile women with PCOS. No data are available on live birth. We are uncertain of the effect of CHM on pregnancy rates for there is no consistent evidence to indicate that CHM influences fertility outcomes. However, we find that the addition of CHM to clomiphene may improve pregnancy rates, but there is very limited, low certainty evidence for this outcome. Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence on adverse effects to indicate whether CHM is safe. In the future, well-designed, carefully conducted RCTs are needed, with a particular focus on the live birth rate and other safety indexes.","clomifene (911-45-5), cyproterone acetate plus ethinylestradiol (60528-19-0)",,10.1002/14651858.CD007535.pub4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007535.pub4,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L635169647&from=export,,"Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Protective effects of berberine in a rat model of polycystic ovary syndrome mediated via the PI3K/AKT pathway,"Yu J., Ding C., Hua Z., Jiang X., Wang C.","Background: Ber, a Chinese herbal monomer has been reported to exhibit an array of pharmacological activities related to the lowering of blood glucose and the treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the effect of berberine (Ber) on a rat model of PCOS mediated via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Methods: A PCOS animal model was induced with the administration of letrozole, and animals were then randomized into untreated or Ber and metformin hydrochloride treated groups. After administration, fasting blood glucose, HOMA-IR, fasting insulin (FINS) values, and the serum hormone levels were measured in PCOS rats. The ovarian tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) for pathological and apoptosis examination. Moreover, the effect of Ber on the proliferation and apoptosis of granulosa cells was detected by CCK-8 assays and flow cytometry. The influence of Ber on granulosa cells was confirmed by blockade of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In addition, the modulatory effect of the blockade of the PI3K/AKT pathway on the expression of related proteins was demonstrated via western blotting. Results: We found that Ber was able to restore the serum hormone levels and improve IR in a PCOS rat model. The morphological lesions and apoptosis of the ovary were also restored by the Ber treatment. Blockade of the PI3K/AKT pathway attenuated the influences of Ber on the proliferation and apoptosis of granulosa cells. Conclusion: The beneficial effects of Ber on PCOS included alterations of the serum hormone levels, recovery of morphological lesions in the ovary, improvement of insulin resistance, and cell viability and inhibition of apoptosis, which were all mediated through the PI3K/AKT pathway.","berberine (2086-83-1, 633-65-8), eosin (17372-87-1, 51395-88-1, 548-26-5), glucose (50-99-7, 84778-64-3), hematoxylin (517-28-2), insulin (9004-10-8), letrozole (112809-51-5), metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (115926-52-8), protein kinase B (148640-14-6)",,10.1111/jog.14730,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jog.14730,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2010766960&from=export,,"Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

During 2016-17; this study was carried out at Abbasi Shaheed hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. A total of 150 patients aged between 18??4 years were included as per Rotterdam criteria. Patients received 500 mg of powdered herbs in capsule form twice daily. The primary outcomes were regular menstruation and ovulation plus change in fasting blood sugar levels. Changes in free testosterone levels and ovarian morphology was secondary outcome measures. Continuous outcomes before and after treatment were compared by Student?™s t-test (one tailed, independent). P = 0.05 was considered as significant. Women menstrual cycle was considerably improved. Fasting blood sugar levels did not change (p=0.103392). Progesterone levels were same at the starting point and after treatment (P=0.318322). With complete recovery in 6 patients; a notable change was found in ovarian size. Free testosterone levels were also dropped significantly (p<0.00001). Our main success was drastic improvement in normalizing menstrual cycle during therapy. Herbal treatment is proven to be clinically effective in most of the patients; particularly PCOs patients with menstrual irregularities. Hence, Femitex-SP(4) can be taken as a better treatment for PCOs.","glucose (50-99-7, 84778-64-3), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.36721/PJPS.2021.34.3.SUP.1097-1102.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.36721/PJPS.2021.34.3.SUP.1097-1102.1,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2012862553&from=export,,"Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Guizhi Fuling Wan reduces autophagy of granulosa cell in rats with polycystic ovary syndrome via restoring the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway,"Liu M., Zhu H., Zhu Y., Hu X.","Ethnopharmacological relevance: Guizhi Fuling Wan (GFW) is a traditional Chinese medicine used to remove blood stasis and dissipate phlegm for treating gynecological diseases that was invented by Zhang Zhongjing in the Eastern Han dynasty. In recent years, GFW has been widely used to treat patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Clinical and animal studies have shown that it is effective in the treatment of PCOS, but its mechanism is unknown. Generally, it works by regulating autophagy via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Aim of the study: This study investigated the effects and mechanism of GFW in PCOS rats with insulin resistance (IR) in order to provide better understanding of its observed clinical effects and a theoretical basis for the study of traditional Chinese medicine. Materials and methods: Eighty-four female Sprague?“Dawley rats were randomly divided into seven groups (n = 12 per group): 1) control, 2) PCOS model, 3) low-dose GFW, 4) medium-dose GFW, 5) high-dose GFW, 6) metformin, and 7) medium-dose GFW plus LY294002. In all non-control groups, we induced PCOS through daily letrozole combined with intragastric high-fat emulsion for 21 days. After treatment, rats were sacrificed and serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone (T), progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), 17Î²-estradiol, fasting insulin (FINS), and fasting plasma glucose levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The LH/FSH ratios and HOMA-IR values were calculated. Ovarian morphology was observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and all follicles were counted under a microscope. MDC-positive vesicles were used as markers to detect autophagy, and the expression levels of p62, Beclin1, and LC3-II were examined by immunostaining. Western blotting was used to measure PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation, granulosa cell apoptosis, and autophagy. Results: Compared with the PCOS model group, GFW-treated rats had less atretic and cystic follicles, and more mature follicles and corpus lutea. The GFW-treated rats had lower serum T, LH, and FINS levels than the PCOS model group, as well as lower LH/FSH ratios and HOMA-IR values. GFW treatment resulted in significantly reduced levels of cleaved-Caspase-3, cleaved-Caspase-9, BAX, Beclin1, Atg5, and LC3-II. Phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR was significantly higher in GFW-treated rats compared with the PCOS model group. The phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR was decreased with the use of a PI3K antagonist. Conclusions: Our results indicate that GFW inhibited granulosa cell autophagy and promoted follicular development to attenuate ovulation disorder in PCOS-IR rats. This was associated with activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.","2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone (154447-36-6), caspase 3 (169592-56-7), caspase 9 (180189-96-2), eosin (17372-87-1, 51395-88-1, 548-26-5), estradiol (50-28-2), follitropin (9002-68-0), glucose (50-99-7, 84778-64-3), hematoxylin (517-28-2), insulin (9004-10-8), letrozole (112809-51-5), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (115926-52-8), progesterone (57-83-0), protein kinase B (148640-14-6), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.1016/j.jep.2021.113821,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.113821,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2010871409&from=export,,"Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Effect of Ultrasound Cavitation Versus Electro Acupuncture on Sex Hormones in Obese Infertile Patients With Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome,,"Brief SummaryThe aim of this study is to determine the difference between the effect of Ultrasound Cavitation and Elctroacupuncture on sex hormones in obese infertile patients with poly cystic ovarian syndrome .............................................................................. BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic disorder that occurs in 6 - 10% of women at the reproductive age. It is associated with an-ovulation, infertility, hyperandrogenism, obesity and insulin resistance. Endocrine characteristics of PCOS are elevated serum concentrations of androgens and Luteinizing hormone (LH) and decreased concentrations of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Ultrasound cavitation is the method in handling Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (, especially in destroying subcutaneous fat and shaping a particular part of the body. As one of the non-surgical correction method, UC is preferred for lowering the risk of complications due to obesity. UC reported a greater decrease of the WHR, suggesting a valuable modification of fat distribution pattern, especially at the abdominal level. It improves rates of ovulation, provides higher incidence of regular menstrual cycles and lower levels of total testosterone. Acupuncture is a treatment method used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Electroacupuncture promotes follicle development and corrects reproductive endocrine dysfunction in ovaries by regulating the functions of the hypothalamus, pituitary and ovariesDetailed DescriptionThis study will be designed as prospective, randomized, single blind, experimental, pre-post test , controlled- trial study.

Complementary and Alternative Medicine for the Treatment of Abnormal Endometrial Conditions in Women with PCOS: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Hu J., Shi W., Xu J., Liu S., Hu S., Fu W., Wang J., Han F.","Background. Endometrial lesions in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) exhibit complex pathological features, and these patients are at risk of both short-term and long-term complications. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), which is gradually becoming more accepted and is believed to be clinically effective, claims to be promising for treating PCOS, and thus its effect on the abnormal endometrium of PCOS patients should be assessed. The present meta-analysis sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CAM in treating endometrial lesions in patients with PCOS. Methods. Randomized trials on CAM were identified in four Chinese and seven English-language databases from their establishment to January 2020. The present study included patients diagnosed with PCOS and abnormal endometrial conditions who underwent CAM therapy independently or in combination with traditional western medicine. Data were extracted, and the Cochrane ""risk of bias""tool was used to assess methodological quality. Effects were expressed as the relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD/SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) as calculated with Rev Man 5.3. Results. A total of 13 randomized controlled trials were included, involving 1,297 PCOS patients treated for endometrial abnormalities. Methodological quality was generally unclear or had a low risk of bias. The trials tested four different types of CAM therapies (i.e., traditional Chinese medicine treatment, acupuncture treatment, traditional Chinese medicine in combination with western medicine treatment, and acupuncture in combination with western medicine treatment). CAM treatment could significantly reduce the endometrial thickness in PCOS patients compared to western medicine alone (SMD -0.88, 95% CI [-0.12, -0.57]; I2 = 64%). Compared with clomiphene treatment for the induction of ovulation, CAM treatment showed a clear improvement in endometrial thickness during ovulation (SMD 2.03, 95% CI [1.64, 2.02]; I2 = 48%). Moreover, CAM was more effective than western medicine alone in reducing the endometrial spiral artery pulsatility index. No significant difference was seen between CAM and traditional treatment when these were used to improve traditional Chinese medicine syndrome scores. Acupuncture alone or traditional Chinese medicines (taken orally) in combination with western medicine significantly increased the pregnancy rate of PCOS patients (RR 1.59, 95% CI [1.30, 1.93]; I2 = 51%, P<0.00001), and CAM was more effective than western medicine alone for improving hormone levels. No serious adverse events were reported in 11 of the 13 trials. Conclusions. CAM may effectively ameliorate the endometrial condition of PCOS patients, and it can regulate the level of hormone secretion to increase the ovulation rate and the pregnancy rate.","chorionic gonadotropin (9002-61-3), clomifene (911-45-5), cyproterone acetate plus ethinylestradiol (60528-19-0), human menopausal gonadotropin (61489-71-2), letrozole (112809-51-5), metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9)",,10.1155/2021/5536849,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/5536849,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2012041574&from=export,,"Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
An Overview of Systematic Reviews of Using Chinese Medicine to Treat Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,"Wang L., Liang R., Tang Q., Zhu L.","Objective. This review sought to evaluate the strength and validity of the existing evidence for the use of Chinese medicine for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods. We retrieved systematic evaluations and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating Chinese herbal interventions in polycystic ovaries, including the use of decoctions or Chinese patent medicines. The quality of these systematic evaluations was assessed using AMSTAR2 tools, and ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, effective rate, serum hormones (testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone), and adverse reactions were recorded. Finally, the reliability of each result was evaluated according to the GRADE system. Data Sources. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, CQVIP, and SINOMED databases were searched up to January 1, 2021. Outcomes. A total of 18 publications were included, all of which showed that PCOS symptoms were improved with Chinese medicine compared with control groups. However, most of the evaluations did not have good research designs and had issues with the analysis of their results. The reliability of most outcome measures was rated low or very low, and it is presumed that the reliability of the results was low due to the poor quality of the RCTs. Conclusions. At present, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that improved efficacy is achieved by the combined use of Chinese and Western medicine compared with Western medicine alone in treating PCOS. Therefore, it is recommended that multicenter, large-sample RCTs adopting standard designs and rigorous methods be carried out in the future while introducing standardized assessment plans for the systematic review of clinical trials so as to improve the quality of the resulting clinical evidence.","clomifene (911-45-5), cyproterone acetate plus ethinylestradiol (60528-19-0), follitropin (9002-68-0), letrozole (112809-51-5), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.1155/2021/9935536,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/9935536,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2012996166&from=export,,"Copyright 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Methods: This is a prospective randomized controlled trial conducted at Peking Union Medical College Hospital Beijing, China, from December 2016 to September 2017. Totally 117 PCOS patients were randomly assigned to the Dingkun Pill group (38 cases), Diane-35 group (40 cases), or combined group (39 cases). Patients in the Dingkun Pill group or Diane-35 group took daily 7 g of oral Dingkun Pill or 1 tablet of oral Diane-35, respectively, for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 drug-free days. And the combined group received a combination of Dingkun Pill and Diane-35. The treatment course was 3 months. Fasting plasma glucose and insulin, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), free fatty acids (FFA) and sex hormones were analyzed, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) was calculated, and menstruation and acne scores were recorded at baseline and after 3-month treatment. Results: Compared with before treatment, QUICKI decreased significantly in the Dingkun Pill and combined groups after 3-month treatment (P<0.05); TC, LDL-C and FFA decreased significantly in the Dingkun Pill group (P<0.01), LDL-C also decreased obviously in the Diane-35 group (P<0.01), while TC increased significantly in the combined group (P<0.01), TG increased significantly in all groups (P<0.01); total testosterone (TT) and menstruation regularity was improved significantly in the Diane-35 and combined groups (P<0.01); acne scores were improved in all groups (P<0.01). After treatment, TC and FFA in the Dingkun Pill group were significantly lower than the Diane-35 group (P<0.05 or P<0.01); TT was lower and regular menstruation rate was higher in the Diane-35 and combined groups than the Dingkun Pill group (P<0.01), and no differences were observed between Diane-35 group and combined group (P>0.05). Conclusions: Dingkun Pill showed better effects than Diane-35 in improving insulin sensitivity, lowering TC and FFA. Diane-35 was more efficient in regulating menstruation and lowering androgen than Dingkun Pill.

METHODS: A total of 60 patients with PCOS of kidney deficiency and blood stagnation pattern were randomized into a combined treatment group and a western medication group, 30 cases in each one. In the western medication group, on the fifth day of menstruation, clomiphene citrate tablets were taken orally, 50 mg each time, once daily, consecutively for 5 days. On the day when the follicle diameter was ??18 mm, chorionic gonadotrophin for muscular injection, a dose of 10 000 U was given. Before sleep, the aspirin enteric-coated tablets were taken orally, 50 mg (except during menstruation). In the combined treatment group, on the base of the treatment as the western medication group, acupuncture and moxibustion were adopted and the Chinese herbal for tonifying the kidney and activating blood circulation was taken orally. The acupoints were Guanyuan (CV 4), Qihai (CV 6), Zusanli (ST 36), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Zigong (EX-CA 1), etc. Acupuncture was remained for 30 min each time, once every two days and discontinued during menstruation. Chinese herbal was given from the 3rd day of menstruation till the onset of the next menstruation, one dose each day. After consecutive treatment for 3 menstrual cycles in the two groups, the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was adopted to determine the expression of serum HOXA10 before and after treatment in the patients of the two groups. The endometrial thickness at ovulatory phase, uterine arterial flow 7 days after ovulation [including uterine arterial pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), peak systolic velocity (PSV)/end diastolic velocity (EDV), meaning S/D], pregnancy rate and the score of Chinese medicine symptoms before and after treatment were compared in the patients between the two groups. RESULTS: ??After treatment, the expression of serum HOXA10 was higher than that before treatment in the patients of the two groups (P<0.01). The increase range in the combined treatment group was larger than the western medication group (P<0.01). ??After treatment, the endometrial thickness at the ovulatory phase was increased in the patients of the two groups (P<0.01). The increase range of the endometrial thickness in the combined treatment group was larger than the western medication group (P<0.01). ??The pregnancy rate was 46.7% (14/30) in the combined treatment group, higher than 26.7% (8/30) in the western medication group (P<0.05). ??After treatment, the bilateral uterine arterial PI, RI and S/D values, as well as TCM symptom score were all lower than those before treatment in the patients of the two groups (P<0.01). The decrease range of each index in the combined treatment group was greater than the western medication group (P<0.01, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The combined treatment with acupuncture, moxibustion and medication effectively improves endometrial receptivity and uterine arterial flow in the patients with PCOS of kidney deficiency and blood stagnation pattern and increases pregnancy rate. The therapeutic effect is better than the simple western medication and its mechanism is probably related to the regulation of serum HOXA10 expression.",,,10.13703/j.0255-2930.20191022-k0006,http://dx.doi.org/10.13703/j.0255-2930.20191022-k0006,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L637605759&from=export,,"This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"
Efficacy of different forms of Guizhi Fuling Wan on reproduction and metabolism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A protocol for a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Liu M., Zhu H., Hu X., Zhu Y., Chen H.","Background:Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is a common endocrine disorder in women characterized by increased androgen levels, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. Western medicine is widely used for the treatment of PCOS, but patient satisfaction is low, largely due to its associated gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea and diarrhea. Guizhi Fuling Wan (GFW) is a traditional Chinese medicine used to remove blood stasis and dissipate phlegm for treating gynecological diseases that was invented by Zhang Zhongjing in the Eastern Han dynasty. In recent years, GFW has been widely used to treat patients with PCOS. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of GFW in the treatment of PCOS through a systematic review and meta-analysis.Methods:All randomized controlled trials connected with GFW targeting PCOS will be searched in the following electronic bibliographic databases from their earliest recorded publications to December 2020 without any language restrictions: MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biological Medicine Database, Wan-fang data, Chinese Technical Periodicals, and other databases.

"Guizhi Fuling Wan, Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ameliorates Insulin Sensitivity in PCOS Model Rats With Insulin Resistance via Remodeling Intestinal Homeostasis","Zhu Y., Li Y., Liu M., Hu X., Zhu H.","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disease with reproductive dysfunction and metabolic disorder in women of childbearing age. Gastrointestinal microbiome contributes to PCOS through mediating insulin resistance. Guizhi Fuling Wan, Chinese herbal medicine, can treat PCOS with insulin resistance (PCOS-IR), but the underlying mechanism is not clear. The aim of this study was to characterize the exact mechanism of Guizhi Fuling Wan action and whether it is related to the regulation of intestinal flora structure. We induced PCOS-IR rat model by means of letrozole sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-na) solution combined with high-fat emulsion administration and randomly divided it into blank control group (K), model control group (M), low dose of Guizhi Fuling Wan group (D), middle dose of Guizhi Fuling Wan group (Z), high dose of Guizhi Fuling Wan group (G) and positive drug (Metformin) control group (Y). After 36 days of modeling and treatment, serum and stool samples from all rats were collected for a follow-up analysis. The data display that, compared with K group, elevated testosterone and HOMA-IR, turbulent estrous cycles and polycystic ovaries in M group, indicating the PCOS-IR rat model is successfully established. Increased fasting insulin is associated with higher inflammation(plasma TNF-Î±, IL-6, and HS-CPR concentration were determined) in M group, and the altered intestinal flora (compared with the K group, in M group the relative abundance of Alloprevotella was decreased significantly, while the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae UCG-008, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136, Lactobacillus, Ruminiclostridium 9, and Ruminococcaceae UCG-003 was increased significantly) induced the secretion of inflammatory markers. On the other hand, Guizhi Fuling Wan can alleviate inflammation, improve insulin resistence: Lower inflammation decreased fasting insulin can be seen in G group compared with M group, this effect is related to the regulating effect of Guizhi Fuling Wan on intestinal flora (in G group, the relative abundance of Alloprevotella, Ruminococcaceae UCG-003, and Lachnospiraceae UCG-008 was increased significantly, compared with M group). This research demonstrates Guizhi Fuling Wan improve insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome with the underlying mechanism of regulating intestinal flora to control inflammation. It would be useful to promote the therapeutic effect of Guizhi Fuling Wan on PCOS-IR.","glucose (50-99-7, 84778-64-3), letrozole (112809-51-5), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.3389/fendo.2020.00575,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00575,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L632813842&from=export,,"Copyright 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Acupuncture combined with chinese and western medicine in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome,"Huang X.-T., Liang S.-R., Wang L.","The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical effect of acupuncture combined with western medicine and Chinese medicine to tonify the kidney, promote blood circulation, and eliminate sputum in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The 156 patients with PCOS who met the diagnostic criteria were randomly divided into the western medicine group who received Diane-35 (n = 40), the Chinese and western medicine group who received Diane-35 plus Chinese medicine to tonify the kidney, promote blood circulation, and eliminate sputum (n = 60), and the acupuncture and medicine group who received Chinese and western medicine plus acupuncture (n = 56). The groups received continuous treatment for three menstrual cycles. The pre- and post-treatment levels of serum testosterone (T) and fasting insulin (FINS), luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ratio, and ovulation rate were compared within the three groups. Compared with before treatment, all three groups showed decreases in the serum T and FINS levels and LH/FSH ratio (all P < 0.05). Moreover, the post-treatment decreases in serum T and FINS levels, LH/FSH ratio, and ovulation rate were superior in the acupuncture and medicine group compared with the western medicine group (P < 0.05) and Chinese and western medicine group (P < 0.05).

Acupuncture or auricular electro-acupuncture as adjuncts to lifestyle interventions for weight management in PCOS: Protocol for a randomised controlled feasibility study,"Ee C., Smith C.A., Costello M., Moran L., Steiner G.Z., Stepto N., Cave A., Albrehee A., Teede H.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent women's health condition with reproductive, metabolic, and psychological manifestations. Weight loss can improve these symptoms and is a key goal; however, many women find this difficult to achieve. Acupuncture is a Chinese medical treatment that involves insertion of very fine metal needles into specific areas of the body and has been shown to be efficacious for weight loss in non-PCOS populations. However, few studies have been conducted in women with PCOS. A variant of acupuncture, auricular electro-acupuncture (AEA), may have beneficial effects on sympathetic tone, which is associated with insulin resistance, obesity and PCOS. Methods: This prospective three-arm open label parallel randomised controlled trial will assess feasibility and acceptability of acupuncture and/or AEA for weight loss in women with PCOS. We will enrol 39 women from the community aged between 18 and 45 years, with physician diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria: body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 40 kg/m(2). Women will be randomly allocated to receive one of three treatments for 12 weeks duration: body electro-acupuncture + lifestyle interventions, AEA + lifestyle interventions, or lifestyle interventions alone. The lifestyle intervention in this study is telephone-based health coaching (between 4 and 13 phone calls, depending on individual need), provided by the Get Healthy Service. Primary outcomes of the study are feasibility and acceptability of trial methods as determined by recruitment and retention rates, adherence, acceptability, credibility, and safety. Secondary outcomes include anthropometric (body weight, BMI, waist and hip circumference), metabolic (glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity obtained from a 2-h 75 g oral glucose tolerance test with area under the curve insulin calculated using the trapezoid rule), reproductive (androgen levels, menstrual cyclicity, clinical hyperandrogenism using the Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system), autonomic (heart rate variability, blood pressure), lifestyle (physical activity levels, diet quality, weight self-efficacy), quality of life, and psychological (depression and anxiety symptoms, internal health locus of control). Discussion: This study addresses the feasibility and acceptability of novel interventions to treat overweight/obesity in PCOS. Study findings have the potential to generate a new understanding of the role of acupuncture and auricular acupuncture in weight management.

"A multicenter randomized trial of personalized acupuncture, fixed acupuncture, letrozole, and placebo letrozole on live birth in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome","Huang S., Hu M., Ng E.H.Y., Stener-Victorin E., Zheng Y., Wen Q., Wang C., Lai M., Li J., Gao X., Wang X., Hu Z., Xia T., Hu R., Liu J., Wen X., Li S., Quan K., Liang X., Shang H., Ma H., Qiao J.","Background: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) usually involves syndrome differentiation and treatment. Acupuncture, one form of TCM, requires the selection of appropriate acupoints and needling techniques, but many clinical trials on acupuncture have used fixed acupuncture protocols without accounting for individual patient differences. We have designed a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate whether personalized or fixed acupuncture increases the likelihood of live births in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared with letrozole or placebo letrozole. We hypothesize that letrozole is more effective than personalized acupuncture, which in turn is more effective than fixed acupuncture, and that placebo letrozole is the least effective intervention. Moreover, we hypothesize that personalized acupuncture is more likely to reduce the miscarriage rate and the risk of pregnancy complications compared with letrozole. Methods/design: The study is designed as an assessor-blinded RCT. A total of 1100 infertile women with PCOS will be recruited from 28 hospitals and randomly allocated to 4 groups: personalized acupuncture, fixed acupuncture, letrozole, or placebo letrozole. They will receive treatment for 16 weeks, and the primary outcome is live birth. Secondary outcomes include ovulation rate, conception rate, pregnancy rate, pregnancy loss rate, changes in hormonal and metabolic parameters, and changes in quality of life scores. Adverse events will be recorded throughout the trial. All statistical analyses will be performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 21.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), and a P value < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Discussion: This study will be the first multicenter RCT to compare the effect of personalized or fixed acupuncture with letrozole or placebo letrozole on live birth in infertile women with PCOS. The findings will inform whether personalized acupuncture therapy can be considered an alternative treatment to improve the live birth rate in infertile women with PCOS.

The effects of flaxseed supplementation on metabolic status in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A randomized open-labeled controlled clinical trial,"Haidari F., Banaei-Jahromi N., Zakerkish M., Ahmadi K.","Background: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is known as the most common endocrine disorder of women in reproductive ages. With the increasing prevalence of PCOS in different countries, the use of herbal medicine as an alternative treatment is growing in these patients. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of flaxseed powder supplementation on metabolic biomarkers of patients with PCOS. Methods: This randomized open-labeled controlled clinical trial was conducted on 41 patients with PCOS. The participants were randomized to take either flaxseed powder (30 g/day) plus lifestyle modification or only lifestyle modification for 12 weeks. Anthropometric and biochemical evaluations were performed for all patients at the beginning and end of the study. Results: The flaxseed group showed a significant reduction in body weight, insulin concentration, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), Triglycerides (TG), high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP), and leptin and an increase in Quantitative Insulin-Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), and adiponectin compared to the baseline (p < 0.05). Flaxseed supplementation also led to a significant reduction in insulin concentration, HOMA-IR, TG, hs-CRP, Interleukin 6 (IL- 6), and leptin and an increase in QUICKI, HDL, and adiponectin compared to the control group (p < 0.05). No significant changes were observed in other parameters. Conclusions: Flaxseed supplementation plus lifestyle modification was more effective compared to lifestyle modification alone in biochemical and anthropometric variables in patients with PCOS.

"Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China",,"Brief SummaryThis is a cross-sectional case-control study combined with a randomised controlled trial (RCT) study. This study aims to compare the effect of acupuncture, with usual care (lifestyle management) for weight control, with BMI (Body Mass index) as main outcome along with improvement of reproductive and metabolic dysfunction in overweight and obese women with PCOS, and further exploring the alteration of lipidomics, bile acid omics, proteomics and branched-chain amino acids between PCOS and the normal controls, and before and after the acupuncture treatment in different gourps.Detailed DescriptionPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 6 to 18% of all women and is the most common female endocrine and metabolic disorder during the reproductive years. PCOS is characterized by anovulation, hyperandrogenism and metabolic dysfunction.Obesity is \~40% higher in women with PCOS than in healthy women. Overweight results in irregular cycles, insulin resistance and infertility. Acupuncture is assumed to reduce weight The overall hypothesis is that if the Body mass index (BMI) decreased, ovulation can be induced, hyperandrogenism decreased, and insulin sensitivity improved in these women. Although several treatment strategies have shown efficacy, importantly, there is a need for Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) to strengthen the evidence base for clinical and policy decision-making. Therefore, the investigators aim to compare the effect of acupuncture, with usual care (lifestyle management) for weight loss, and improvement and prevention of reproductive and metabolic dysfunction in overweight and obese women with PCOS.

Integrative Chinese herbal medicine therapy reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome: A nationwide matched cohort study,"Liao W.-T., Su C.-C., Lee M.-T., Li C.-J., Lin C.-L., Chiang J.-H., Yen H.-R.","Ethnopharmacological relevance: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition that affects 5%??0% of women of reproductive age worldwide. Patients with PCOS have a high degree of insulin resistance and are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The currently available therapeutic approaches for PCOS mainly focus on symptomatic treatment. Aim of the study: This study aimed to determine whether Chinese herbal medicine (CMH)-based interventions could reduce the risk of T2DM in PCOS patients. Materials and methods: This retrospective study randomly selected 1 million enrollees from the National Health Insurance Database and identified 3797 patients who were newly diagnosed with PCOS in 1997??010. After 1:1 frequency-matched by age, diagnosis of PCOS year and index days, we selected 342 eligible patients in each group. Results: The incidence of T2DM in the CHM group was significantly lower than that in the non-CHM group (hazard ratio = 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.15??.64; p = 0.0014) after a mean follow-up period of 5.2 years (4.20 years for the comparison cohort).

Manual acupuncture for the infertile female with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Study protocol for a randomized sham-controlled trial,"Wang Q., Deng H., Cheng K., Huang Z., Yin X., Zhou Y., Yang Y., Shen W., Zhao L., Shen X.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine diseases for women. Acupuncture is widely used for the infertile female because of it is non-invasive and has fewer side effects, but the powerful evidence for the clinic is still insufficient. Our study intends to explore the effect of manual acupuncture (MA) in the infertile female with PCOS. Methods: This study is a randomized, sham-controlled, patient-and assessor-blinded trial and aims to evaluate the effect of MA in women with PCOS and infertility. We will recruit 86 women aged 20-40 years with a diagnosis of infertility with PCOS. Participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the MA group and the sham acupuncture (SA) group. Both groups will receive real herbal medicine treatment as a basic treatment twice a day for three menstrual cycles, the MA group receive real acupuncture treatment and the SA group received placebo acupuncture treatment (non-penetrating). All patients will receive acupuncture treatment twice per week for three menstrual cycles. The primary outcome is pregnancy rate and secondary outcomes include ovulation rate, sex hormones, insulin resistance index (IRI), PCOS symptoms, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome scores. Outcome measures will be collected at baseline, each menstrual cycle, the end of treatments, and six months after the last acupuncture treatment. The present protocol followed the SPIRIT guidelines and fulfilled the SPIRIT checklist. Discussion: This study will be conducted to compare the efficacy of MA versus SA. This trial will help to evaluate whether MA is effective in increasing pregnancy and ovulation rates of the infertile female with polycystic ovary syndrome.

"Effect of Foeniculum vulgare essence on symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS): A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","Ghavi F., Taghizadeh M., Taebi M., Abdolahian S.","Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of ovulatory infertility with an endocrine origin. An alternative therapy for PCOS is complementary medicine (CM), with herbal medicine becoming the most popular during the past ten years. The fennel plant (Foeniculum Vulgare Mill) belongs to the flowering plant of the fennel Apiaceae family. It is a medicinal plant that is commonly recommended by practitioners of Iranian traditional medicine for ovarian or unknown infertility in women because it has an estrogenic effect. The effects of fennel (FOEVU: Foeniculum vulgare Mill essence of fennel seeds) on PCOS has yet to be investigated. Therefore, the main objective of our study was to investigate and evaluate the effects of fennel essential oil capsules on PCOS symptoms. Subjects and methods: This study was a double-blinded, randomized controlled study. Our subjects were thirty female students who were selected from the age range of 20??5 and met the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for PCOS. The subjects were randomly assigned to two groups: fennel (study) and placebo (control). The ultrasonography assessments, body mass index, biochemical, and hirsutism variables were measured individually before and after three months usage of the fennel and placebo as our main outcome measurements. The comparison between the quantitative data obtained for the two studied groups was carried out using the Man-Whitney and chi-square tests. Results: The comparison of menstruation cycle, hirsutism, BMI, biochemical, and ultrasonography measurements revealed that the interventions did not cause significant differences in the two groups, except in the dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) and both ovarian follicles number (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Fennel was not effective in alleviating the ovarian cyst symptoms in polycystic women but since the sample size calculation in our small study was based on very large effect sizes, the study might not be powered enough to detect smaller effects.","follitropin (9002-68-0), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), prasterone sulfate (651-48-9), prolactin (12585-34-1, 50647-00-2, 9002-62-4), testosterone (58-22-0), thyrotropin (9002-71-5)",,10.1016/j.hermed.2019.100277,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hermed.2019.100277,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2001967953&from=export,,"Copyright 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

METHODS: From PubMed, EMbase, the Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang database and VIP database, the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on PCOS were retrieved in the period from the date of database establishment to January 8, 2018. Two researchers screened the articles, extracted the data and assessed the bias risk of the eligible trials independently. Using Stata 13.0 and WinBUGS 1.4.3 software, the data were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 39 RCTs were collected, including 4605 cases of PCOS and 14 kinds of acupuncture-related therapies and the comprehensive therapies. The short-term therapeutic effects were observed. The results of mesh meta-analysis showed: regarding the ovulation rate, the effects of the acupuncture-medication therapy were better than western medication. The top 6 therapeutic measures were the treatment with acupoint thread-embedding therapy and medication (93.3%), the treatment with moxibustion and Chinese herbal medicine (91.4%), moxibustion (74.5%), the treatment with acupuncture and medication (65.7%), the treatment with acupuncture-moxibustion and auricular point therapy (61.9%) and the treatment with acupuncture and auricular point therapy (49.6%).

Acupuncture for infertile women without undergoing assisted reproductive techniques (ART) A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Yun L., Liqun W., Shuqi Y., Chunxiao W., Liming L., Wei Y.","Background: Acupuncture is widely used for infertile women without undergoing assisted reproductive techniques (ART) in China but its effect is unclear. We aim to assess whether acupuncture and its combined therapy exert a positive influence on the outcome of female fertility. Methods: We searched 6 databases, including Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and Wan-Fang Data, from inception to June 2018. Studies of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on women with infertility treated by acupuncture or its combined therapy were included. A meta-analysis was performed using Revman 5.3. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed through the risk of bias assessment tool by the Cochrane Collaboration. Results: The pregnancy rate was significantly improved with treatment (RR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.10, P < .00001), compared to that in the control group. Subgroup analysis showed that comparing with pure western medicine intervention, no matter intervention with acupuncture alone, with acupuncture plus western medicine, with acupuncture plus Chinese medicine, or acupuncture plus Chinese medicine and western medicine, all of these subgroups exhibited significant improvement. The subgroup according to different types of infertility showed a significant improvement in infertility caused by polycystic ovary syndrome, tubal infertility, ovulatory disorder, and other factors. In addition, the ovulation rate and endometrial thickness were significantly increased. The level of LH was obviously decreased. Moreover, with acupuncture, less adverse effects occurred. The funnel plot revealed that publication bias might exist. All trials included had unclear risks in the aspects of allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, selective reporting, and other bias. Only 1 study was assessed as unclear risk in random sequence generation. In the incomplete outcome data, all studies were low risk, except 1. Conclusions: Acupuncture and its combined therapy may be effective for treating female infertility. However, the included studies are not robust enough to draw a firm conclusion due to the not robustly sampled quality of the included studies. Future high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm our findings.

Methods: A total of 117 women with PCOS were randomly assigned to Group A (38 women), Group B (40 women), or Group C (39 women) in a randomization sequence with SAS software and a 1:1:1 allocation ratio using random block sizes of 6, and were given 7 g of oral DKP daily (Group A), 1 tablet of Diane-35 orally daily (Group B), or 7 g of oral DKP daily plus 1 tablet of Diane-35 orally daily (Group C). Patients took all drugs cyclically for 21 consecutive days, followed by 7 drug-free days. The treatment course for the 3 groups was continued for 3 consecutive months. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed before treatment and again after 2 and 3 months of therapy, respectively, and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were calculated. Results: Of 117 women with PCOS, 110 completed the entire course of therapy: 35 in Group A, 36 in Group B, and 39 in Group C. After treatment, all three groups showed significant decreases in fasting glucose: at 1 h glucose decreased significantly in Group A (by 0.5 Â± 1.4 mmol/L, P=0.028) and Group C (by 0.5 Â± 1.2 mmol/L, P=0.045); while showing a tendency to increase in Group B (by 0.4 Â± 1.9 mmol/L, P=0.238). HOMA-IR decreased significantly in Group C [by 0.5 (??.2 to 0.5) mIU mmol/L(2), P=0.034]. QUICKI was significantly increased in Groups A and C (by 0.009 Â± 0.02, P=0.033 and by 0.009 Â± 0.027, P=0.049, respectively), while no change was observed in Group B. Repeated-measure ANOVA showed that the absolute changes in all parameters (except for glucose at 1 h), including glucose and insulin levels at all time-points during OGTT and in HbA1c, HOMA-IR, and QUICKI, were not significantly different among the 3 groups after treatment (P>0.05).

Overview of systematic reviews of non-pharmacological interventions in women with polycystic ovary syndrome,"Pundir J., Charles D., Sabatini L., Hiam D., Jitpiriyaroj S., Teede H., Coomarasamy A., Moran L., Thangaratinam S.","BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a major contributor to subfertility, diabetes and cardiovascular disease in women. The role of non-pharmacological interventions to prevent these outcomes has been reported in many systematic reviews, but robust conclusions have not been made due to variations in the scope, quality and findings of these reviews. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Our aim was to provide an overview of existing evidence on the effects of non-pharmacological interventions in women with PCOS on fertility and non-fertility outcomes by a review of existing systematic reviews. SEARCH METHODS: We reviewed systematic reviews of randomized trials that have evaluated the effects of non-pharmacological interventions, such as lifestyle interventions, nutritional supplements or alternative medicine therapies in women with PCOS on fertility, endocrine, glycaemic and weight-related outcomes. We assessed the quality of systematic reviews with the AMSTAR tool, and reported the outcomes with regard to: fertility (live birth, clinical pregnancy, ovulation and menstrual cycle regularization); endocrine outcomes (Ferriman-Gallwey score, free androgen index, free testosterone and total testosterone levels); and glycaemic (fasting blood insulin, fasting blood glucose, homoeostatic model assessment) and weight-related (BMI) outcomes. We assessed the strength of evidence for significant outcomes as per the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) system. OUTCOMES: We found twelve eligible systematic reviews which included between three (143 women) and 27 randomized trials (2093 women). Four reviews assessed the effects of lifestyle interventions (diet, physical activity and/or behavioural interventions); four evaluated nutritional supplements (one each on n-acetylcysteine, omega-3 fatty acids, inositol and vitamin D); and four studied alternative medical therapies (Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture). All of the included reviews were of high quality and scored between 8 and 11 with the AMSTAR tool (with a maximum score of 11). Randomized evidence is lacking for live birth rate. N-acetylcysteine, inositol and the addition of alternative medicine to ovulation induction agents show preliminary potential to improve fertility (odds ratios (OR) for clinical pregnancy rate range from 1.99 to 4.83). Lifestyle interventions show benefits in improving hirsutism (mean difference (MD): -1.01 to -1.19). Lifestyle interventions (MD: -1.10 to -2.02), inositol (MD: -2.1) and acupuncture (MD: -1.90 to -3.43) all show some evidence of improvement in glycaemic outcomes and there is some evidence of reduced BMI with lifestyle interventions (MD: -0.15 to -1.12). All of these outcomes scored either low or very low quality of evidence on the GRADE score. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Lifestyle interventions in women with PCOS appear to improve glycaemic results, androgenic symptoms and anthropometric outcomes. The role of inositol and N-acetylcysteine in women with PCOS needs further evaluation. Large primary trials on all interventions are needed for an agreed set of core outcomes.","acetylcysteine (616-91-1), clomifene citrate (50-41-9), glucose (50-99-7, 84778-64-3), inositol (55608-27-0, 6917-35-7, 87-89-8), insulin (9004-10-8), metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.1093/humupd/dmy045,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmy045,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L626673352&from=export,,"Copyright 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Herbal medicine plus lifestyle for overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A randomised control trial.,"Arentz S., Smith C., Abbott J., Bensoussan A.","PCOS is the most common reproductive endocrinopathy of women, the most common cause ovarian infertility and cause of significant distress. Lifestyle modification (dietary and exercise) is first-line evidence based treatment however there are barriers to success for this form of self-care and women often seek adjunct therapies including herbal medicines. This pragmatic, randomized controlled trial (RCT), delivered in communities of Australia in overweight women with PCOS, compared the effectiveness and safety of naturopathic herbal medicine plus lifestyle intervention against lifestyle alone. 122 overweight women with PCOS participated in this RCT. The herbal medicine consisted of two tablets; tablet one contained Cinnamomum verum, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Hypericum perforatum and Paeonia lactiflora and tablet two contained Tribulus terrestris. The primary outcome was oligo/amenorrhea. Secondary outcomes were hormones, anthropometry, quality of life (QoL), depression, anxiety and stress (DAS), pregnancy, birth outcomes, and safety. At three months, women in the herbal medicine plus lifestyle group recorded a reduction in oligomenorrhoea of 32.9% (95% CI, 23.3-42.6,p<0.01) compared to controls, estimated as a large treatment effect size (Î·p2=0.11).

Therapeutic mechanisms of herbal medicines against insulin resistance: A review,"Li J., Bai L., Wei F., Zhao J., Wang D., Xiao Y., Yan W., Wei J.","Insulin resistance is a condition in which insulin sensitivity is reduced and the insulin signaling pathway is impaired. Although often expressed as an increase in insulin concentration, the disease is characterized by a decrease in insulin action. This increased workload of the pancreas and the consequent decompensation are not only the main mechanisms for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but also exacerbate the damage of metabolic diseases, including obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, metabolic syndrome, and others. Many clinical trials have suggested the potential role of herbs in the treatment of insulin resistance, although most of the clinical trials included in this review have certain flaws and bias risks in their methodological design, including the generation of randomization, the concealment of allocation, blinding, and inadequate reporting of sample size estimates. These studies involve not only the single-flavored herbs, but also herbal formulas, extracts, and active ingredients. Numerous of in vitro and in vivo studies have pointed out that the role of herbal medicine in improving insulin resistance is related to interventions in various aspects of the insulin signaling pathway. The targets involved in these studies include insulin receptor substrate, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, glucose transporter, AMP-activated protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3, mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, nuclear factor-kappaB, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.

Oriental herbal medicine and moxibustion for polycystic ovary syndrome: A meta-analysis,"Kwon C.-Y., Lee B., Park K.S.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common disorders of reproductive endocrinology in women of reproductive age. Lifestyle intervention and oral contraceptives are the first-line treatments for PCOS. Recent studies have suggested that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and mind-body therapy have the potential to alleviate the symptoms and/or pathology of PCOS and to improve the quality of life of women with PCOS. This metaanalysis aimed to quantitatively summarize the efficacy and safety of moxibustion combined with oriental herbal medicine (OHM), common CAM therapies, for treating PCOS. Methods: Four databases were searched from their inception to June 22, 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs using both OHM and moxibustion as experimental intervention, and western medication (WM) as control intervention were included. Studies involving OHM plus moxibustion combined with WM as the experimental intervention were also included. The quality of included studies was assessed using risk of bias tool. Results: Owing to the heterogeneity of reporting, meta-analysis was only performed for pregnancy rate, rate of normal biphasic basal body temperature (BBT), and total effective rate (TER). The results showed that compared to the WM group, the OHM combined with moxibustion group was associated with significantly higher pregnancy rate (risk ratio [RR] 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.55-2.47; I(2) = 0%), normal biphasic BBT rate (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.34-2.05; I(2) = 0%), and TER (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.31; I(2) = 0%). When OHM combined with moxibustion was used as an adjunctive therapy to WM, pregnancy rate (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.29-2.11; I(2) = 0%), and TER (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13-1.61; I(2) = 43%) were significantly higher than those of the WM group. Conclusion: According to current evidence, OHM combined with moxibustion might be beneficial for treating PCOS. Moreover, the treatment might improve the therapeutic effects of conventional WMs including clomiphene citrate, oral contraceptives, and/or metformin.

Among the proposed strategies for its treatment, herbal medications are of importance due to favorable effect profiles. Objectives: We planned a study to compare the effects of Celery and Anise combination (CAC) and metformin (met.) on oligomenorrhea in PCOS patients. Methods: We conducted a triple-blind, Randomized clinical trial on 72 patients that were randomly allocated into two equal groups to receive six capsules of either CAC (750 mg each) or met. (250 mg each) at three separate doses for 15 days beginning from the follicular phase. If the bleeding occurred, three capsules of either placebo or met. would be administered daily during the menstruation phase, and then the follicular phase step with six capsules would be repeated. If the bleeding did not occur, three capsules of either placebo or met. would be administered each day for 15 days. The regularity of menstrual bleeding as the primary outcome, as well as testosterone, luteinizing hormone/follicular stimulating hormone ratio (LH/FSH), and complications, was assessed before and after the three cycles.

Ashwagandha root in the treatment of prediabetes,"Simon K., Inoue T., Fenteany G., Bahtiyar G., Sacerdote A.","Background: Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) root has been used as a ?œtonic??or adaptogen for millenia both in Aryuvedic and traditional Chinese medicine. Anwer reported that when low-dose streptozotocin treated (Type 2 diabetic) mice were given a standardized preparation of Ashwagandha root there were significant improvements in both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. Our group has reported clinical and biochemical improvement using Ashwaganda root in patients with 3 different forms of non-classic adrenal hyperplasia, a family of disorders, which like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), is associated with insulin resistance (IR). Trivedi et al reported downregulation of expression of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and MIP-1Î± by Ashwagandha in vitro. Here we report the experience of a patient with prediabetes, whose hemoglobin A1c improved in association with the use of Ashwagandha. Clinical case: Our patient is 56 year old woman with Class III obesity, BMI=49.4 kg/m2, who on routine screening was found to have a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) by high performance liquid chromatography of 6.4%, consistent with pre-diabetes. She started taking a standardized preparation of Ashwagandha root 400 mg orally 2x/day. She did not make any changes in lifestyle. Three months later she repeated her HbA1c in the same laboratory and found that it had declined to 5.9%, while her weight declined from 135.0 kg to 131.8 kg. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first report of Ashwagandha root usage in a human for the treatment of pre-diabetes. The HbA1c reduction observed is similar to the magnitude reported with dipeptyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors or alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Our patient's experience suggests that it may be worthwhile to design double-blind, randomized control trials of a standardized Ashwagandha root preparation in the treatment of prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. The possible mechanisms could involve improved insulin sensitivity and secretion and reduced inflammation.","hemoglobin A1c (62572-11-6), macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (155075-84-6), proline dipeptidase (9025-32-5)",,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L623114100&from=export,,"Copyright 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Therapeutic effects on ovulation and reproduction promotion with acupuncture and clomiphene in polycystic ovary syndrome,"Yu L., Cao L., Xie J., Shi Y.","OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference in the therapeutic effects on ovulation disorder in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) between the combined therapy of electroacupuncture and clomiphene and the single medication of clomiphene and to explore the effect mechanism. METHODS: A total of 80 patients of PCOS were randomized into an acupuncture plus medication group (40 cases) and a medication group (40 cases). In the medication group, since the 5th day of menstruation or medicine-withdrawal bleeding, clomiphene was prescribed for oral administration, continuously for 5 days. In the acupuncture plus medication group, the medication was the same as the medication group. Additionally, 30 min electroacupuncture (continuous wave, 2 Hz) was applied to Qihai (CV 6), Guanyuan (CV 4), Zigong (EX-CA 1), Dahe (KI 12), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Zhongji (CV 3), Diji (SP 8), Shenshu (BL 23), Sanjiaoshu (BL 22) and Ciliao (BL 32), etc. The treatment started on the 5th day of menstruation or medicine-withdrawal bleeding, once every two days, 3 times a week. One cycle of menstruation or 1 month was taken as one course. The treatment cycles were 3 months in the two groups. The level of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) in the serum, the endometrial thickness and morphology, ovulation rate and clinical pregnancy rate, as well as the clinical therapeutic effects were compared after treatment in the two groups. RESULTS: Two cases were dropped out because the herbal medicine was taken simultaneously in the acupuncture plus medication group. In the medication group, the medication was discontinued in 3 cases due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions. The total effective rate was 86.8% (33/38) in the acupuncture plus medication group, better than 64.9% (24/37) in the medication group (P<0.05). The ovulation rate in the acupuncture plus medication group was higher than that in the medication group [(86.8%, 33/38) vs (64.9% 24/37), P<0.05]. The pregnancy rate in the acupuncture plus medication group was higher than the medication group in tendency, without significant difference [21.1% (8/38) vs 16.2% (6/37), P>0.05]. After treatment, the results of endometrial thickness and morphology (A-type rate) in the acupuncture plus medication group were better than those in the medication group (P<0.01, P<0.05). After treatment, regarding the levels of E2 and P in the serum in the window period of implantation, the results in the acupuncture plus medication group were higher remarkably than those in the medication group (both P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The combined intervention of electroacupuncture and clomiphene achieves the definite effects of ovulation and pregnancy promotion in PCOS. It remarkably increases the levels of E2 and P in the serum, the endometrial thickness and A-type rate. The therapeutic effects of the combined intervention are remarkably better than those of the simple application of clomiphene. This combined intervention is safe and tolerable for the adverse reactions.

Clinical therapeutic effects of acupuncture combined with Chinese herbal medicine on infertility of polycystic ovary syndrome in the patients with ovulation induction with letrozole,"Yin Y., Zhang Y., Zhang H., Jiang D., Guo G.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical therapeutic effects and safety on infertility of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in the patients with ovulation induction with letrozole in the treatment with the formula for regulating menstruation and removing phlegm and electroacupuncture (EA). METHODS: A total of 120 patients of PCOS infertility were randomized into 3 groups, 40 cases in each one. In the group A, diane-35 was prescribed for oral administration (one tablet a day since the 5th day of menstruation, continuously for 21 days). After 1 course of treatment (3 months), letrozole was used (one tablet a day since the 5th day of menstruation, continuously for 5 days) for ovulation induction for another 1 course (3 months). In the group B, on the basis of the treatment as the group A, since the 5th day of menstruation, the Chinese herbal formula was combined to regulate menstruation and remove phlegm, one dose a day and discontinued during menstruation. In the group C, on the basis of the treatment as the group B, EA was added since the 5th day of menstruation. The main acupoints were Guanyuan (CV 4), Zusanli (ST 36) and Fenglong (ST 40), etc. EA was applied once every 2 days and discontinued during menstruation. In all of the 3 groups, the treatment for 3 months was as 1 course and the 2 courses were required continuously. Before and after treatment, the menstruation improvements, body weight, body mass index (BMI), serum sex hormones [luteal production hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), LH/FSH, total testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2)] were observed in the patients of each group. The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was adopted to determine the content of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B (IHNB). The therapeutic effects, safety, ovulation rate and pregnancy rate were compared among the 3 groups. RESULTS: (1) The differences were significant statistically in the total effective rate, ovulation rate and pregnancy rate in comparison of the 3 groups (all P<0.05). The results in the group C were the best and those in the group B were the better in the comparison of the 3 groups. (2) After treatment, the menstrual cycle was remarkably shortened in the 3 groups (all P<0.05). The result in the group C was better than that in the group A (P<0.05). After treatment, the body weight in the group B and group C was all reduced (both P<0.05). The reducing degree in the group C was better than that in the group A (P<0.05). The differences in BMI were not significant statistically before and after treatment in each group as well as in comparison among the groups (all P>0.05). (3) After treatment, the levels of LH and LH/FSH were all reduced remarkably in the 3 groups (all P<0.05). The differences were not significant statistically in comparison among the three groups (all P>0.05). After treatment, in the group B and group C, the levels of T and AMH were all reduced remarkably (all P<0.05), in which, T value in the group C was lower than that in the group A and group B, that in the group B was lower than the group A (all P<0.05). AMH value in the group C was lower than that in the group A (P<0.05). The differences were not significant statistically in FSH, E2 and IHNB before and after treatment in each group as well as in comparison among the 3 groups (all P>0.05). (4) The luteinized unreuptured follicle syndrome (LUFS) did not happen in the group C. There were 3 cases of LUFS (7.5%) in the group B and 5 cases (12.5%) in the group A. CONCLUSION: For PCOS infertility patients receiving ovulation induction with letrozole, the combined treatment with the Chinese herbal formula for regulating menstruation and removing phlegm and EA remarkably improves the menstrual cycle, reduces body weight and the levels of LH, LH/FSH, T and AMH, improves ovulation and pregnancy rates. This therapy does not induce adverse reactions and the therapeutic effects are better than the simple application of letrozole or the combined therapy of letrozole and Chinese herbal medicine.","estradiol (50-28-2), follitropin (9002-68-0), letrozole (112809-51-5), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.13703/j.0255-2930.2018.01.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.13703/j.0255-2930.2018.01.006,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L637574512&from=export,,"This record is sourced from MEDLINE/PubMed, a database of the U.S. National Library of Medicine"
Nutritional supplements and herbal medicines for women with polycystic ovary syndrome; a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Arentz S., Smith C.A., Abbott J., Bensoussan A.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common, reproductive endocrinopathy associated with serious short and long term health risks. Many women with PCOS use ingestible complementary medicines. This systematic review examined the effect on menstrual regulation and adverse effects from randomised controlled trials. Methods: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared herbal or nutritional supplements to placebo or active controls in women with PCOS were eligible for inclusion. Electronic databases were searched to July 2017. Study selection and assessment of quality were conducted independently by two review authors. Results: Twenty four studies (1406 women) investigating seven nutritional supplements and four herbal medicines were included. No one study was assessed as having a low risk of bias. Four trials reported on the primary endpoint menstrual regulation. There was no evidence on improved menstrual regularity for calcium plus vitamin D compared to Metformin (RR: 0.66, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.23, p=0.19), reduced amenorrhoea for Camellia sinensis compared to placebo (RR: 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.72, p=0.13) and no difference in the number of menses per month for Cinnamomum sp. against placebo (MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.36 to 1.36, p=0.26). Adverse effects were investigated in seven studies (164 women). Mild adverse effects were found for Cinnamomum sp. compared to placebo (17 women, RR: 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.70, p=0.03). No difference was found for adverse effects between inositol, B complex vitamins, vitamin D, chromium and placebo. Improved reproduction, metabolic hormones and hyperandrogenism was found for inositol and improved cholesterol for omega three fish oils. Conclusion: There is no high quality evidence to support the effectiveness of nutritional supplements and herbal medicine for women with PCOS and evidence of safety is lacking. High quality trials of nutritional supplements and herbal medicines examining menstrual regulation and adverse effects in women with PCOS are needed.","adrenochrome (54-06-8, 72993-60-3), calcium (7440-70-2, 14092-94-5), cholesterol (57-88-5), chromium (16065-83-1, 7440-47-3, 14092-98-9), fish oil (8016-13-5), inositol (55608-27-0, 6917-35-7, 87-89-8), metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9), selenium (7782-49-2)",,10.1186/s12906-017-2011-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-2011-x,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L619387660&from=export,,"Copyright 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Acupuncture and Chinese medicine of artificial cycle therapy for insulin resistance of polycystic ovary syndrome with phlegm damp type and its mechanism,"Yang J., Liu Y., Huang J., Xu J., You X., Lin Q., Zhang J., Dun J., Huang S.","OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect difference between acupuncture combined with Chinese medicine of artificial cycle therapy on the basis of western medication and simple western medication for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) of phlegm damp type with insulin resistance, and to explore its mechanism. METHODS: Sixty patients were randomly assigned into an observation group and a control group, 30 cases in each group. Patients of the control group began to take letrozole and metformin orally on the third menstrual day. Patients of the observation group were treated with acupuncture combined with Chinese medicine of artificial cycle therapy on the basis of the treatment of the control group. The main acupoints were Guanyuan (CV 4), Qihai (CV 6) and bilateral Zigong (EX-CA 1), Luanchao (Extra), Fenglong (ST 40), Yinlingquan (SP 9), Zusanli (ST 36), Sanyinjiao (SP 6). Dahe (KI 12) was matched in the follicular phase, and warm acupuncture was applied at Guanyuan (CV 4) and Qihai (CV 6); Zhongji (CV 3) and Xuehai (SP 10) were matched in the ovulatory phase, and electroacupuncture were used at Qihai (CV 6) and Zhongji (CV 3), Xuehai (SP 10) and Yinlingquan (SP 9), 2 Hz and continuous wave; The acupoints in the luteal phase were the above main acupoints, at the same time, moxibustion was used at Guanyuan (CV 4) and Qihai (CV 6), the treatment was given once every other day, 30 min a time. There was no treatment in the menstrual phase. Chinese medicine was applied for tonifying kidney and nourishing blood, strengthening spleen and eliminating phlegm. The patients of the two groups were treated for continuous three menstrual cycles. The indexes before and after treatment were detected, including serum microRNA-29 (miR-29) expression, TCM symptom score, insulin (INS), blood-sugar content and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, the endocrine hormone values of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T), LH/FSH ratio, prolactin (PRL). The pregnancy rates of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: After treatment the expressions of miR-29 and TCM symptom scores of the two groups were lower than those before treatment (P<0.01, P<0.05), with better results in the observation group (P<0.01, P<0.05). The levels of LH LH/FSH and T of the observation group were lower than those before treatment (P<0.01, P<0.05), and the T value in the control group decreased after treatment (P<0.05). The changes of LH and LH/FSH in the observation group were better than those in the control group (both P<0.05). After treatment, The INS, blood-sugar content and HOMA-IR were lower than those before treatment in the two groups (P<0.05, P<0.01), with better results for INS and HOMA-IR improvements in the observation group (both P<0.05). The pregnancy rate in the observation group was 56.7% (17/30), which was significantly higher than 30.0% (9/30) in the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture combined with Chinese medicine of artificial cycle therapy can improve the endocrine levels and insulin resistance of PCOS with phlegm damp type.

Beneficial effects of Heqi san on rat model of polycystic ovary syndrome through the PI3K/AKT pathway,"Zhao H., Zhou D., Chen Y., Liu D., Chu S., Zhang S.","Background: Heqi San, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been reported to regulate hormone levels in patients with metabolic disease, suggesting a potential clinical application. In the current study, we aimed to elucidate the effect of Heqi San on rat model of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Method: PCOS model was established in female SD rats. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: the control, untreated PCOS model, Heqi San treated PCOS model (8.1 g/kg) and metformin (MET) treated PCOS model (135 mg/kg) groups. All animals were subcutaneously injected with 6 mg/100 g dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in the neck once a day for 20 consecutive days. The serum hormone levels were measured by ELISA. The ovarian tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to undergo pathological examination. The expression levels of GLTU4 and PTEN mRNA were examined by real time PCR. The crucial proteins in the PI3K/APT pathway were analyzed by western blotting. Then, the functions of the target genes were analyzed using bioinformatics approaches. Results: We found that Heqi San was able to recover the serum hormone levels and improve insulin resistance in PCOS rat model. A morphological lesion of the ovary was also restored with the Heqi San treatment. More importantly, we discovered a correlation between the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and the beneficial effects of Heqi San, demonstrating that its application could alter the expression levels of p-ERK, p-AKT, p-GSK3Î², IRS-1, PTEN and GLTU4, all key factors in the PI3K/APT pathway. Through a bioinformatical analysis, we predicted the related gene function and pathway of the pathological mechanism of PCOS and found miRNAs that are likely to be critical in PCOS occurrence, including rno-miR-144-3p, rno-miR-30c-2-3p, rno-miR-486, rno-miR-3586-3p and rno-miR-146b-5p. Conclusion: The beneficial effects of Heqi on PCOS, including alter serum hormone levels, recover ovary morphological lesions and improve insulin resistance, which is mediated through the PI3K/AKT pathway.

Combined Lifestyle and Herbal Medicine in Overweight Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Arentz S., Smith C.A., Abbott J., Fahey P., Cheema B.S., Bensoussan A.","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common, complex reproductive endocrinopathy characterized by menstrual irregularities, hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries. Lifestyle modification is a first-line intervention; however, there are barriers to success for this form of self-care, and women often seek adjunct therapies including herbal medicines. This pragmatic, randomized controlled trial, delivered in communities of Australia in overweight women with PCOS, compared the effectiveness and safety of a lifestyle intervention plus herbal medicine against lifestyle alone. All participants were helped to construct a personalized lifestyle plan. The herbal intervention consisted of two tablets. Tablet 1 contained Cinnamomum verum, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Hypericum perforatum and Paeonia lactiflora. Tablet 2 contained Tribulus terrestris. The primary outcome was oligomenorrhoea/amenorrhoea. Secondary outcomes were hormones; anthropometry; quality of life; depression, anxiety and stress; pregnancy; birth outcomes; and safety. One hundred and twenty-two women gave their consent. At 3 months, women in the combination group recorded a reduction in oligomenorrhoea of 32.9% (95% confidence interval 23.3??2.6, p < 0.01) compared with controls, estimated as a large effect (Î·(p)(2) = 0.11). Other significant improvements were found for body mass index (p < 0.01); insulin (p = 0.02) and luteinizing hormone (p = 0.04); blood pressure (p = 0.01); quality of life (p < 0.01); depression, anxiety and stress (p < 0.01); and pregnancy rates (p = 0.01).

Comparison of the effects of ginger extract with clomiphene citrate on sex hormones in rats with polycystic ovarian syndrome,"Atashpour S., Jahromi H.K., Jahromi Z.K., Maleknasab M.","Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women which affect fertility. Clomiphene citrate is used as first-line treatment for this disorder, which is associated with some complications and therapeutic resistance. Objective: In this research, we compare the effectiveness of ginger with clomiphene on sexual hormones such as Luteinizing hormone (LH), Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estrogen and progesterone in order to treat PCOS effectively with fewer side effects. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 63 adult female rats (170-200 gr) were studied and divided randomly into 9 groups as control (not received any interventional substance for 60 and 89 days), sham (were given distilled water and ethyl alcohol intraperitoneally daily for 60 and 89 days), and 7 experimental groups receiving estradiol valerate (PCOS inducing agent, intramuscular) alone and with 100 mg/kg clomiphene or different doses of ginger extract (175 and 350 mg/kg) orally daily for 60 and 89 days. Sexual hormones were analyzed and compared in different groups. Results: Our results showed that in the PCOS-induced group, LH and estrogen concentration increased while progesterone and FSH concentration decreased remarkably (p<0.05) as compared to control group. Furthermore, in groups receiving clomiphene and ginger extract, we demonstrated significant (p<0.05) improvement in hormonal secretion as compared to the PCOS-induced group. Clomiphene, compared with the lower dose of ginger extract, had a better improving effect on balancing sexual hormones in PCOS. Moreover, ginger extract at higher doses has better effects in improving PCOS.

What is known already: Lifestyle intervention is first line treatment for overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and may regulate menstruation, reduce hyperandrogenism, treat hyperinsulinaemia and improve quality of life. However, the strength of evidence for lifestyle is limited by high attrition in RCTs and clinical uptake remains impeded by the lack of evidence for optimal dietary and exercise practices. In addition, physical and psycho social barriers are commonly observed in overweight women, particularly those with established obesity. Many women use additional complementary medicine including herbal medicines, however despite potential positive endocrine effects in PCOS, there is no evidence of effectiveness or safety. Study design, size, duration: This study examined the relative effectiveness of combined lifestyle intervention and herbal medicine compared to lifestyle alone for oligomenorrhoea in overweight women with PCOS in a prospective, randomized controlled trial conducted between in August 2012 to June 2014. We consented and randomized 122 women to three months of lifestyle plus herbal medicine (n = 60) or lifestyle intervention alone (n = 62). Participants/materials, setting, methods: The interventions were delivered in urban and regional communities in Australia. Participants were overweight women with PCOS (Rotterdam criteria), not taking contraceptive pills or antidepressants. Energy deficit, personalized lifestyle plans were revised fortnightly. The herbs included daily dosed Cinnamomum verum, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Hypericum perforatum, and Paeonia lactiflora with Tribulus terrestris on menstrual cycle days 5-14. The primary outcome was oligomenorrhoea. Secondary outcomes were serum hormones, anthropometry, quality of life, psychology, pregnancy, birth and blood pressure. Main results and the role of chance: At three months the mean menstrual cycle length was 43 days (95% CI, 21 to 65, p < 0.001) lower for women in the combination group compared to those in the lifestyle only group.Secondary outcomes were significantly improved for women taking combined herbal medicine and lifestyle compared to controls for BMI (MD -1.0 95% CI -1.6 to -0.5, p < 0.01), increased oestradiol (MD 68.9 pmol/L, 95% CI 5.5 to 132.3, p = 0.03); lowered LH (MD -1.82IU/L, 95% CI -3.5 to -0.1, p = 0.04), fasting insulin (MD -5.9mU/l, 95% CI -10.9 to -1.0, p = 0.02; systolic (MD -3.6 mmHg, 95%CI-6.3 to -0.9, p = 0.01) and diastolic (-5.1 mmHg, 95%CI -7.8 to - 2.4, p < 0.01) blood pressure; PCOSQ score (MD -31.1, 95% CI -41.4 to -20.7, p < 0.01), depression (-4.3, (95% CI -5.9 to -2.7, p < 0.01), anxiety (-4.0, 95% CI -5.4 to -2.6, p < 0.01) and stress (-5.0, 95% CI -6.5 to -3.5, p < 0.01) scores and increased conception rates (RR 3.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 13.1, p = 0.01). The residual effect of loss of body weight on the primary outcome (number of days in the menstrual cycle) after controlling for baseline menstrual variation was not significant (p = 0.07). Two women in in the herbal medicine group were withdrawn due to non-serious adverse effects. Limitations, reasons for caution: The lack of a placebo group prevents identification of the active component of this herbal and lifestyle intervention that has generated these outcomes. The lack of blinding could have influenced the estimated treatment effect size and confounded the outcomes particularly for subjective outcomes such as self-reported QoL, psychology and compliance. Wider implications of the findings: In light of the limitations for lifestyle intervention for overweight women with PCOS, changes demonstrated in this study, with both specific gynaecological, physical and mental health improvements are an important finding.There were no serious adverse events during the trial, and non-serious adverse effects were fewer compared to pharmaceutical interventions.","estradiol (50-28-2), insulin (9004-10-8)",,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L617484136&from=export,,"Copyright 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Characteristics and obstetrics outcomes of different traditional Chinese medicine syndromes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A secondary analysis,"Wang Y., Gao J.-S., Cai W.-Y., Xie L.-Z., Ma H.-L., Zhang Y.-H., Cong J., Liu J.-P., Ernest H.Y.Ng., Wu X.-K.","Introduction: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is widely used for infertility of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in China. TCM treatment is based on syndrome, which is a group ofTCM symptoms and signs shared by different patients. Characteristics vary significantly among different TCM syndromes, similar to the phenotypic diversity of Rotterdam criteria. Objectives: To investigate characteristics and obstetrics outcomes among women with PCOS in different TCM syndromes. Methodology/process: This is a secondary-analysis of a randomized controlled trial. We randomized 1000 women with PCOS for clomiphene/placebo and acupuncture/placebo. Using a self-report questionnaire, subjects were divided into four syndromes ""kidney deficiency and liver stasis"" (KL), ""spleen deficiency and phlegm stasis"" (SP), ""phlegm stasis and blood stasis"" (PB) and ""kidney deficiency and blood stasis"" (KB). Baseline characteristics including biometric, biochemical, fertility information and obstetric outcomes including ovulation, conception, pregnancy, live birth, pregnancy loss and neonatal information were analyzed. Results/outcomes: The most common TCM syndrome was KLs (40.29 %), followed by SPs (32.27 %), PBs (16.55 %) and KBs (10.89 %). KLs showed tendency to have psychological or mental problems. SPs had serious metabolic abnormalities including higher body weights, body mass index, waist and hip circumferences, systolic blood pressure, free androgen index, triglycerides, alanine transaminase and occurrence of metabolism syndrome. PBs had higher free testosterone and insulin. KBs presented more severe reproductive disorder including higher luteinizing hormone and the ratio of luteinizing hormone to follicle stimulation hormone. Obstetric outcomes and complications had no difference among four groups, as well as the days from randomization to first ovulation and conception. Conclusion: Although TCM is a pragmatic medicine, whose syndrome differentiation is often a subjective judgment, but it indeed objectively reflects the severity of diseaseinPCOS women. Kidney deficiency syndrome is associated with psycologcial or mental problems, while Phlegm syndrome had more severe glucolipid metabolic abnormalities.","alanine aminotransferase (9000-86-6, 9014-30-6), clomifene (911-45-5), follitropin (9002-68-0), insulin (9004-10-8), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.1111/jog.13393,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jog.13393,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L616813328&from=export,,"Copyright 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Effectiveness of co-treatment with traditional Chinese medicine and letrozole for polycystic ovary syndrome: a meta-analysis,"Ma Q.-W., Tan Y.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disease that affects gynecological health. Treatment of PCOS remains a big challenge for clinicians. Objective: This meta-analysis was developed to compare the efficacy of co-treatment with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and letrozole against letrozole monotherapy in the treatment of PCOS. Search strategy: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were electronically retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane Library, China Biomedical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Data; related papers that were not available electronically were manually checked. All papers were assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the valid data were analyzed using Revman software (The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). Inclusion criteria: We included RCTs that compared co-treatment with TCM and letrozole against letrozole monotherapy in women with PCOS, which was defined by anovulation, biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenemia and polycystic ovaries. We included trials from all sources. Data extraction and analysis: Two independent reviewers extracted data, and evaluated study quality according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions criteria for RCT, including issues of patient randomization, blinding and bias. Results: Eight RCTs, involving a total of 537 patients, were included in the present study. The meta-analysis showed that the cycle ovulation rate, the pregnancy rate and the total effective rate of symptom treatment were higher in treatments combining TCM with letrozole, compared with letrozole monotherapy. Although the rate of luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and the body mass index of the group receiving combined therapy were lower than in letrozole monotherapy, no statistical difference was found in the LH and FSH level between the two groups. Conclusion: Available evidence showed that co-treatment with TCM and letrozole was more effective than letrozole monotherapy in the treatment of PCOS.","follitropin (9002-68-0), letrozole (112809-51-5), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9)",,10.1016/S2095-4964(17)60320-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-4964(17)60320-0,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2000641311&from=export,,"Copyright 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Standardised versus individualised multiherb Chinese herbal medicine for oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea in polycystic ovary syndrome: A randomised feasibility and pilot study in the UK,"Lai L., Flower A., Prescott P., Wing T., Moore M., Lewith G.","Objectives: To explore feasibility of a randomised study using standardised or individualised multiherb Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), to pilot study methods and to obtain clinical data to support sample size calculations. Design: Prospective, pragmatic, randomised feasibility and pilot study with participant and practitioner blinding. Setting: 2 private herbal practices in the UK. Participants: 40 women diagnosed with PCOS and oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea following Rotterdam criteria. Intervention: 6 months of either standardised CHM or individualised CHM, 16 g daily taken orally as a tea. Main outcome measures: Our primary objective was to determine whether oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea were appropriate as the primary outcome measures for the main study. Estimates of treatment effects were obtained for menstrual rate, body mass index (BMI), weight and hirsutism. Data were collected regarding safety, feasibility and acceptability. Results: Of the 40 participants recruited, 29 (72.5%) completed the study. The most frequently cited symptoms of concern were hirsutism, weight and menstrual irregularity. Statistically significant improvements in menstrual rates were found at 6 months within group for both standardised CHM (mean difference (MD) 0.18Â±0.06, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.29; p=0.0027) and individualised CHM (MD 0.27 Â±0.06, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.39; p<0.001), though not between group ( p=0.26). No improvements were observed for BMI nor for weight in either group. Improvements in hirsutism scores found within group for both groups were not statistically significant between group ( p=0.09). Liver and kidney function and adverse events data were largely normal. Participant feedback suggests changing to tablet administration could facilitate adherence. Conclusions: A CHM randomised controlled trial for PCOS is feasible and preliminary data suggest that both individualised and standardised multiherb CHMs have similar safety profiles and clinical effects on promoting menstrual regularity. These data will inform the design of a study in primary care that will incorporate an appropriate control.","alanine aminotransferase (9000-86-6, 9014-30-6)",,10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011709,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011709,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L614288338&from=export,,"Copyright 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
"The Effect of Metformin and Cinnamon on Serum Anti-Mullerian Hormone in Women Having PCOS: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled Trial","Wiweko B., Susanto C.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is known to be associated with insulin resistance and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), leading to the use of insulin-sensitizing agents (ISAs) to manage PCOS. Metformin is the most widely used ISA to treat irregular menstruation; however, the gastrointestinal side effects are quite debilitating. The development of herbal medicines such as bioactive fraction DLBS3233 offers a possibly effective treatment with minimal side effects. Aim: To determine the effect of metformin and DLBS3233 on serum AMH level. Materials and Methods: This study was a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial conducted between March 2013 and June 2015 at Yasmin Clinic, RSCM Kencana, Jakarta and Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung. The patients with PCOS were diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria. All participants received daily treatment consisting of 1500 mg metformin divided into two doses or 100 mg DLBS3233 for 6 months. An evaluation of serum AMH level was conducted before and after the completion of therapy. Results: Twenty patients received metformin, whereas 18 patients received DLBS3233. The levels of AMH prior to the intervention were 9.30 Â± 5.06 ng/mL and 11.27 Â± 6.47 ng/mL. After 6 months of therapy, we found that the decrease in AMH level was higher in the metformin group compared to the DLBS3233 group (?AMH = 1.83 ng/mL, P = 0.003 and ?AMH = 1.15 ng/mL, P = 0.077, respectively). However, more side effects were observed in the metformin group compared to the DLBS3233 group (P = 0.01). A total of seven patients (18.42%) were confirmed as pregnant during the study. Conclusion: There was a significant decrease in the serum AMH level after administration of either metformin or DLBS3233.","metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9), Muellerian inhibiting factor (80497-65-0)",,10.4103/jhrs.JHRS_90_16,http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/jhrs.JHRS_90_16,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L615630880&from=export,,"Copyright 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine usage in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome,"Chu J.-Y., Liu C.-Y.","Background: The prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine usage has been increasing in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Large-scale investigations of current traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) usage trends among them is still lacking. Objective(s): To investigate the utilization of traditional Chinese medicine in Patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Material/Methods: One cohort with one million patients who were randomly sampled from the beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance Program in Taiwan from January 1 to December 31 in 2010, was chosen for analysis. People who had at least three outpatient or inpatient records and had been diagnosed with PCOS from 2002 to 2010 were defined as patients with PCOS (the ICD-9-CM codes 256.4 and ultrasound, N= 2,386). Patients had at least one TCM outpatient clinical record were defined as TCM users (N = 1,552), whereas patients who had no TCM outpatient records were defined as non-TCM users (N = 484). Results: The demographic data and the disease distributions of the TCM users with PCOS was analyzed from one randomly sampled cohort. Overall, 76.2% of the patients with PCOS had used TCM treatment from 2002 to 2010. The PCOS cases are mainly distributed around age 18-39, reproductive age. The most common comorbidity of PCOS is menstrual abnormality. (TCM = 1,358 and non-TCM = 313, p < 0.001). In the number of TCM visits, patients tended to visit TCM clinics in Taiwan prescribed only Chinese herbs and combination treatment (n = 399 and n = 327, respectively.

Comparing the effects of agnugol and metformin on oligomenorrhea in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome: A randomized clinical trial,"Shayan A., Masoumi S.Z., Shobeiri F., Tohidi S., Khalili A.","Introduction: Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy and cause of oligomenorrhea in women. Aim: The present study was conducted with the aim to compare the effect of Agnugol and Metformin drugs on oligomenorrhea in patients with PCOS. Materials and Methods: This study was a clinical trial on 120 women with PCOS and had oligomenorrhea, referring to a gynaecology clinic Fatemieh, Hamadan city, Iran, 2015. Women were randomly divided into 2 groups using permutation blocks (getting the medications Agnugol and Metformin) and for 3 months were treated with the drug Agnugol and Metformin. Data collection included demographic questionnaire and cheek list was designed before and end of interventions, was completed by both groups. To analyse the data, descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-test, ANOVA with repeated measures was used. Results: The mean and SD of age was 39.45Â±4.60 for women taking Agnugol and 38.466Â±0.84 for those taking Metformin. Based on the between-subject results, the two Agnugol-and Metformin-taking groups were not significantly different in terms of menstruation length, cycle intervals, or the number of pads, meaning that the two drugs had similar effects on menstrual cycle regulation, menstruation length and the number of pads. More side effects were reported in the group using Metformin. Conclusion: Agnugol and Metformin drugs in the treatment of oligomenorrhea patients with PCOS have the same effect. Since Metformin is a chemical drug with side effects, Agnugol can be presented as its herbal alternative to treat oligomenorrhea.","metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9)",,10.7860/JCDR/2016/22584.9040,http://dx.doi.org/10.7860/JCDR/2016/22584.9040,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L613458032&from=export,,"Copyright 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Effect of acupoint catgut embedding therapy combined with Chinese medicine for nourishing the kidneys and promoting blood circulation and improving blood glucose and lipid levels as well as the pregnancy rate in obese PCOS patients with infertility,"Qin W., Zhao K., Yang H.","In this study, we explored the effect of acupoint catgut embedding combined with Chinese medicine for nourishing kidney and promoting blood circulation as well as improving the glucose and lipid levels and pregnancy rate in obese poly cystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients with infertility. A total of 62 obese patients with PCOS were randomly divided into three groups, 21 of whom were treated with acupoint catgut embedding combined with Chinese medicine, another 21 with catgut embedding therapy, and 20 only with Chinese medicine. We compared the improvement of clinical symptoms and the glucose and lipid levels in the three groups three months after surgery. We found that the effective rate of obesity treatment, body mass index and waist?‘to?‘hip ratio of acupuncture-drug group and catgut embedding group were significantly lower than those of the Chinese medicine group (P<0.05). A comparison between the acupuncture-drug group and catgut embedding group was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The triglyceride (TG) and high?‘density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels of the three groups were significantly decreased and increased, respectively, following treatment, with the total cholesterol (TC) level being decreased significantly only in the acupuncture-drug group (P<0.05), and the LDL level showing no significant difference (P>0.05). The fast insulins, HOMA-IR, TG, TC levels and periodic cancellation rate of the acupuncture-drug group was significantly reduced compared to those of the catgut embedding group and Chinese medicine group after treatment, whereas the HDL levels, periodic ovulation rate and clinical pregnancy rate were higher (P<0.05). However, a comparison between Chinese medicine group and catgut embedding group was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The incidence rate of luteinized unruptured follicle and ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome of the three groups showed no statistical difference (P>0.05).

Chinese herbal medicine for subfertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome,"Zhou K., Zhang J., Xu L., Wu T., Lim C.E.D.","Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive endocrinology abnormalities, and affects 5% to 10% of women of reproductive age. Western medicines, such as oral contraceptives, insulin sensitizers and laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD), have been used to treat PCOS. Recently, many studies have been published that consider Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) as an alternative treatment for women with PCOS. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of CHM for subfertile women with PCOS. Search methods: We searched sources, including the following databases, from inception to 9 June 2016: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), PsycINFO, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, Wanfang and trial registries. In addition, we searched the reference lists of included trials and contacted experts in the field to locate trials. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that considered the use of CHM for the treatment of subfertile women with PCOS. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened appropriate trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in included studies and extracted data. We contacted primary study authors for additional information. We conducted meta-analyses. We used the odds ratios (ORs) to report dichotomous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods. Main results: We included five RCTs with 414 participants. The comparisons in the included trials were as follows: CHM versus clomiphene, CHM plus clomiphene versus clomiphene (with or without ethinyloestradiol cyproterone acetate (CEA)), CHM plus follicle aspiration plus ovulation induction versus follicle aspiration plus ovulation induction alone, and CHM plus laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) versus LOD alone. The overall quality of the evidence for most comparisons was very low. None of the included studies reported live birth rate, and only one study reported data on adverse events. When CHM was compared with clomiphene (with or without LOD in both arms), there was no evidence of a difference between the groups in pregnancy rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 5.06; two studies, 90 participants, I2 statistic = 0%, very low quality evidence). No study reported data on adverse events. When CHM plus clomiphene was compared with clomiphene (with or without CEA), there was low quality evidence of a higher pregnancy rate in the CHM plus clomiphene group (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.65 to 4.14; three RCTs, 300 women, I2 statistic = 0%,low quality evidence). No data were reported on adverse events. When CHM with follicle aspiration and ovulation induction was compared with follicle aspiration and ovulation induction alone, there was no evidence of a difference between the groups in pregnancy rates (OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 5.52; one study, 44 women, very low quality evidence), severe luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome (LUFS) (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.06 to 6.14; one study, 44 women, very low quality evidence), ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.00 to 8.19; one study, 44 women, very low quality evidence) or multiple pregnancy (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.06 to 6.14; one study, 44 women, very low quality evidence). When CHM with LOD was compared with LOD alone, there was no evidence of a difference between the groups in rates of pregnancy (OR 3.50, 95% CI 0.72 to 17.09; one study, 30 women, very low quality evidence), No data were reported on adverse events. There was no evidence of a difference between any of the comparison groups for any other outcomes. The quality of the evidence for all other comparisons and outcomes was very low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or adverse events, failure to describe study methods in adequate detail and imprecision due to very low event rates and wide CIs. Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of CHM for women with PCOS and subfertility. No data are available on live birth, and there is no consistent evidence to indicate that CHM influences fertility outcomes. However there is very limited low quality evidence to suggest that the addition of CHM to clomiphene may improve pregnancy rates. There is insufficient evidence on adverse effects to indicate whether CHM is safe.","clomifene (911-45-5), cyproterone acetate (427-51-0), ethinylestradiol (57-63-6)",,10.1002/14651858.CD007535.pub3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007535.pub3,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L612675376&from=export,,"Copyright 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

No data were reported on adverse events.When CHM with follicle aspiration and ovulation induction was compared with follicle aspiration and ovulation induction alone, there was no evidence of a difference between the groups in pregnancy rates (OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 5.52; one study, 44 women, very low quality evidence), severe luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome (LUFS) (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.06 to 6.14; one study, 44 women, very low quality evidence), ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.00 to 8.19; one study, 44 women, very low quality evidence) or multiple pregnancy (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.06 to 6.14; one study, 44 women, very low quality evidence).When CHM with LOD was compared with LOD alone, there was no evidence of a difference between the groups in rates of pregnancy (OR 3.50, 95% CI 0.72 to 17.09; one study, 30 women, very low quality evidence), No data were reported on adverse events.There was no evidence of a difference between any of the comparison groups for any other outcomes. The quality of the evidence for all other comparisons and outcomes was very low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or adverse events, failure to describe study methods in adequate detail and imprecision due to very low event rates and wide CIs.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of CHM for women with PCOS and subfertility. No data are available on live birth, and there is no consistent evidence to indicate that CHM influences fertility outcomes. However there is very limited low quality evidence to suggest that the addition of CHM to clomiphene may improve pregnancy rates. There is insufficient evidence on adverse effects to indicate whether CHM is safe.","clomifene (911-45-5), cyproterone acetate (427-51-0), ethinylestradiol (57-63-6)",,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L616148064&from=export,,Copyright 2017 Medline is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.
Effects of Cangfu Congxian Decoction on Oxidative Stress in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Patients,"Liang Y., Tian Q., Mu Y., Du H.","OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Cangfu Congxian Decoction (CCD) on oxidative stress in granulosa cells of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients.METHODS: Forty PCOS patients underwent in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) were assigned to the treatment group and the control group 1 according to random digit table, 20 in each group. Patients in the treatment group took CCD (200 mL, once in the morning and once in the afternoon) 2 months before IVF-ET, while those in the control group 1 took no Chinese medical decoction. Recruited were another 20 patients undergoing IVF-ET for tubal factors (as the control group 2). The clinical effect of IVF-ET were observed, including oocyte retrieval number, 2 pronuclear (2PN) fertilization rate, good quality embryo rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) induced transplantation cancel rate. The expression of relative oxygen species (ROS) in granulosa cells was detected using cell immunofluorescence combined with confocal microscopy and FCM.RESULTS: Compared with the control group 1, occyte retrieval number, 2PN fertilization rate, and good quality embryo rate increased in the control group 2 and the treatment group (P <0. 05). OHSS induced transplantation cancel rate decreased in the control group 2 (P < 0.05). Fluorescence intensity of ROS decreased in the treatment group and the control group 2, as compared with the control group 1 (P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: CCD increased good quality embryo rate by down-regulating the expression of ROS protein in ovarian granulosa cells, and correcting in vivo oxidative stress.",,,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L612457321&from=export,,Copyright 2016 Medline is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.
The effect of agnugol and metformin drugs on oligomenorrhea in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome: A randomized clinical trial,"Shayan A., Masoumi Z., Shobeiri F., Asadi M.","Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy and cause of oligomenorrhea in women. The present study aimed to compare the effect of Agnugol and Metformin drugs on oligomenorrhea in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. Materials and Methods: This study is a clinical trial on 120 women with polycystic ovary syndrome and has oligomenorrhea, referring to a gynecology clinic Fatemieh Hamadan, was carried out in 1394. Women were availably selected and were randomly replaced in groups including 60 people by using permutation blocks (getting the medications Agnugol and metformin), and for 3 months were treated with the drug Agnugol and metformin. Data collection included demographic questionnaire and chek list was designed before and end of interventions, was completed by both groups. To analyze the data, descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t test, ANOVA with repeated measures was used. Results: The mean and SD of age was 39.45 Â± 4.60 for women taking Agnugol, and 38.466 Â± 0.84 for those taking metformin. Based on the between-subject results, the two Agnugol- and Metformintaking groups were not significantly different in terms of menstruation length, cycle intervals, or the number of pads, P<0.005, meaning that the two drugs had similar effects on menstrual cycle regulation, menstruation length, and the number of pads. More side effects were reported in the group using metformin. Conclusion: Agnugol and Metformin drugs in the treatment of oligomenorrhea patients with polycystic ovary syndrome have the same effect.

An atractylodes macrocephala koidz extract alleviates hyperandrogenism of polycystic ovarian syndrome,"Zhou J., Qu F., Barry J.A., Pan J.-X., Wang F.-F., Fu Z.-Z., Duez P., Hardiman P.J.","Background: Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz (AMK) is a tonic herb widely prescribed in most Asian countries, which has been clinically used as the dominant herb in most of the Chinese medicinal formula of treating polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Objective: To explore the effects of a polar extract of AMK (EAMK) in a hyperandrogenic rat model of PCOS induced by testosterone propionate. Material and methods: Sixty rats were randomly allocated to five groups of 12: healthy controls; untreated PCOS; three groups of treated PCOS (high, medium and low-dose EAMK). PCOS was induced with a single injection of testosterone propionate on the ninth day after birth. The plasma levels of total testosterone (TT), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), androstenedione, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), antimÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The expression of FSH receptors (FSHR) and aquaporin-9 (AQP-9) in the ovaries of the rats was measured by real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. We also measured the expression of FSHR and AQP-9 in human ovarian granulosa-like KGN cells, control and EAMK-treated, in the absence and presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Results: EMAK significantly improved the estrous cycles, decreased the plasma levels of TT, FAI and androstenedione of the PCOS rats in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.01) and the EAMK groups displayed significantly higher plasma FSH levels and lower LH/FSH and AMH levels than the PCOS control group (P < 0.001). In a dose-dependent manner, the EAMK treatments significantly decreased the FSHR expression levels and increased AQP-9 expression both in the ovaries of PCOS rats (P < 0.001) and in the KGN cells treated with DHT (P < 0.001).

Effect of Quyu Huatan decoction on lipid metabolism and hormone levels of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome,"Chen W.-J., Wang F.-F.","To study the effect of prescription for removing blood stasis and resolving phlegm on lipid metabolism and hormone levels of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. Totally 93 cases of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome treated in our hospital from March 2013 to July 2014 were randomly divided into control group and observation group. The observation group was treated by oral administration of Quyu Huatan decoction, while the control group was treated with metformin. The result indicated that the total effective rate of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (?(2) = 632, P <0.05). After treatment, the score of syndrome for traditional Chinese medicine in the observation group was significantly lower than the control group (t = 13. 865, P <0.05). After treatment, the levels of TG, BMI, TC in the observation group were significantly lower than the control group (P <0.05), and the difference of HDL between the two groups were not significantly. After treatment, the levels of FSH, LH and T in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P <0.05). After treatment, FBG and INS in the two groups were significantly decreased (P <0.05); the FBG in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group (t=3. 981, P <0.05), and the INS level in the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group (t =6.472, P <0.05).

Setting up herbal medicine trials in the United Kingdom: Lessons from a randomised feasibility study for chinese herbal medicine and polycystic ovary syndrome,"Lai L., Flower A., Moore M., Lewith G.","Purpose: Herbal medicines are widely used in the UK but few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted in primary care to date. Using our experiences of setting up an RCT in Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) as a case study, we present lessons learnt and highlight key challenges for future researchers wishing to conduct herbal medicine research within a UK primary care setting. Methods: We planned to conduct a randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled feasibility study in primary care, offering standardised CHM or placebo for 6 months to women of reproductive age with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and oligo- or amenorrhoea. Results: Our study design was classified by the Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) as a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product (CTIMP). This required a number of criteria to be fulfilled for trial approval such as the involvement of a Qualified Person (QP), a CHM manufacturer who could demonstrate Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards equivalent to the EU, and submission of scientific information regarding both CHM and placebo.

The ameliorating effect of gut microbiota-targeted clinical intervention on metabolic disorders of impaired glucose tolerance women with PCOS,"Ding X., Liu R., Shen J., Wang X., Yan Q., Greenberg A.S., Zhao L., Peng Y.","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common heterogeneous endocrine disease associated with metabolic disorders. Compared with healthy women, a large proportion of women with PCOS also have obesity, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. We investigated the ameliorative effect on PCOS characteristics by a gut microbiotatargeted dietary or acarbose intervention. Thirty-four PCOS patients were recruited and randomly assigned into WTP group (intervention with diets based on whole grains, traditional Chinese medicinal foods and prebiotics) and APW group (acarbose plus above intervention). There was significant difference in the serum levels of insulin, ghrelin, spexin, testosterone and LH before and after the twelve-week intervention in APW group. Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Blautia and Clostridium XlVa were dominant genus in pre-intervention PCOS patients. Bacteroides and Clostridium XlVa decreased, while Bifidobacterium increased after intervention in both groups. 56 key OTUs were clustered into 11 co-abundance groups (CAGs). CAG3 and CAG9 displayed significant correlation with testosterone level in a negative manner, while CAG10 had a significant positive correlation with serun level of LH/FSH throughout the intervention procedure. After intervention, butyric acid basically kept steady, while isovaleric acid decreased significantly in both groups. Cytotoxicity of fecal water in both groups significantly decreased after intervention. In general, both simple WTP diet intervention and WTP diet combined with acarbose improved the reproductive and metabolic disorders of PCOS patients, and regulated the gut microbiota structure and metabolite.

Effect of Qingre Yangyin Recipe on Endocrine and Metabolism of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Patients,Zhang T.,"OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Qingre Yangyin Recipe (QRYYR) on sex hormones and insulin resistance (IR) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients.METHODS: Totally 90 PCOS patients were randomly assigned to the Chinese herbs group,the Western medicine group, the combined group, 30 in each group. Patients in the Chinese herbs group took QRYYR, one dose per day in two portions, once in the morning and once in the evening. Patients in the Western medicine group took Metformin 500 mg, twice per day for 3 consecutive months. Patients in the combined group took QRYYR and Metformin (the same as the former said two groups) in the 1st month, and took QRYYR for the following two months. Fasting blood glucose (FPG) and postprandial 2 h blood glucose (2 h GLU) were determined using hexokinase method before and after treatment. Fasting insulin (FINS), postprandial 2 h insulin (2 h INS), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), prolactin (PRL), and testosterone (T) were detected using chemiluminescent method. Leptin and adiponectin (APN) were determined using ELISA. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. Body weight and height were measured once before treatment and once after treatment to calculate body mass index (BMI). The total two-phase basal body temperature (BBT) actually obtained within 3 months was statistically collected to calculate the two-phase BBT rate. Scores for Chinese medical syndromes were compared between the two groups before and after treatment.RESULTS: Compared with before treatment in the same group, BMI, FINS, 2 h INS, HOMA-IR, leptin, LH, PRL, T, and scores for Chinese medical syndromes obviously decreased, and APN levels increased (P < 0.05). FPG and 2 h FPG obviously decreased in the Western medicine group and the combined group (P < 0.05). E2 levels obviously decreased in the combined group with statistical difference (P < 0.05). Compared with the Chinese herbs group, the difference of BMI between pre-treatment and post-treatment was more in the combined group (P < 0.05). The difference of FPG,2 h GLU, 2 h INS, HOMA-IR, and APN between pre-treatment and post-treatment was more in the Chinese herbs group and the combined group (P < 0.05). Compared with the Western medicine group, the difference of PRL, T, and scores for Chinese medical syndromes was more in the Western medicine group and the combined group (P < 0.05); the difference of E2 and LH was even more in the combined group (P < 0.05). Compared with the combined group, the biphasic rate was obviously lowered in the Western medicine group (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: QRYYR could improve IR but with weaker power to that of Metformin. It also could decrease serum levels of LH, T, PRL, and scores for Chinese medical syndromes, with superior effect to that of Metformin.

Alternative therapies or complementary medicine. debate: Useful vs useless,Ng E.H.Y.,"More than 70% of the world's populations have used some forms of alternative therapies for health care, mainly as a compliment to standard care or as a second line treatment after the first line treatment fails or leads to significant side effects. The use of these alternative therapies is especially common among women of reproductive age. Acupuncture may restore ovulation among patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, but there are not a sufficient number of randomized studies to validate this. Evidence supporting the role of acupuncture in male subfertility is also insufficient. Acupuncture can be considered as an alternative for pain relief during oocyte pickup in patients who cannot tolerate the conventional conscious sedation because of its associated adverse effects. Several meta-analyses showed no evidence of overall benefit of acupuncture for improving live birth rate of in vitro fertilization (IVF). In China, a large number of infertile couples are using Chinese herbal medicine as an adjuvant therapy to improve their success when undergoing IVF. A meta-analysis reveals use of Chinese herbal medicine improves IVF success but there is a high risk of bias observed with the trials. Although alternative therapies are widely used among women, strong evidence for its effectiveness is still lacking in many areas. The limitations of relevant studies include small sample sizes, nonrandomized or uncontrolled samples, and the self-selected nature of the participants. Thus more adequate size randomized studies are urgently needed.",,,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L72068790&from=export,,"Copyright 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

Effects of fennel on serum hormone levels in students with polycystic ovary syndrome,"Ghavi F., Shakeri F.","Objectives: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder, accompanied by oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. This condition is diagnosed by hyperandrogenic clinical results or laboratory findings. There are two major criteria for determining PCOS: lack of ovulation and hyperandrogenism, which are confirmed by clinical or laboratory findings. In addition to chemical treatments, the effects of herbal medicines, e.g., fennel, on PCOS treatment have been confirmed in resources such as the ?œCanon of Medicine??and other traditional Iranian resources. Materials and Methods: This clinical trial was conducted on 30 female students, living in dormitories of Jahrom University of Medical Sciences. The subjects were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. Hormone tests were carried out before and after the intervention. The intervention group received 46 mg fennel capsules twice a day, while the placebo group received 100 mg paraffin capsules in the same manner for 90 days. Results: The intervention and control groups were similar in terms of demographic data (p=0.739) and hormone levels before the intervention. The serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were analyzed, using Mann-Whitney U test before and after the intervention. No statistical difference was reported after three months of intervention (p= 0.298, 0.178, 0.641 and 0.021, respectively).

Effect of Acupuncture Pre-treatment Combined With Letrozole on Live Birth in Infertile Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,,"Brief SummaryThis is a study protocol for a multicenter, randomized, and controlled trial. In this protocol, we present a randomized controlled trial comparing acupuncture pretreatment followed by letrozole vs letrozole alone in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women with anovulatory infertility. The high prevalence of insulin resistance (IR) in women with PCOS women is considered to be one of the major pathophysiological changes of PCOS, leading to anovulatiory infertility. A study has shown that electro-acupuncture could significantly improve insulin sensitivity. The effect of acupuncture pretreatment on anovulatory PCOS women followed by ovulation induction has not been investigated before. A total of 384 patients enrolled in this study will be randomized into one of two groups. The treatment group: a 16 week acupuncture pretreatment followed by 4 cycles of letrozole and the control group: 4 cycles of letrozole alone. The primary outcome is the live birth rate. We postulate that acupuncture pretreatment followed by letrozole results in a higher live birth rate when compared with letrozole alone.Detailed Description1.

Other 10ml blood is for determination of DNA. 1.5 Intervention arms Eligible patients will be randomized into one of the two arms: Treatment group: i.e. a 16 week acupuncture pretreatment followed by LE. Acupuncture treatment will start on day 3-5 after a spontaneous period or after a withdrawal bleeding following progestin. All subjects will be requested to use contraception during the 16 week acupuncture pretreatment. They will receive acupuncture treatment three times a week. Each treatment session lasts for 30 minutes and can be separated by an interval of 1-3 days, with a maximum of 48 treatment sessions during 16 weeks. After 16 weeks of acupuncture treatment, LE will start on day 2-3 after a spontaneous period or after a withdrawal bleeding after progestin administration. The subjects will be instructed to have intercourse on a regular basis during the cycles. Control group: i.e. LE alone. LE will be started on day 3-5 after a spontaneous period or a withdrawal bleeding following progestin. The subjects will be instructed to have intercourse on a regular basis during the cycles. 1.5.1 Acupuncture protocol Investigators base the rationale of acupuncture protocols on Western Medical theories and the study protocol follows the CONSORT and STRICTA recommendations with detailed descriptions of the treatment including number of needle used, how needles will be stimulated (manual, electrical), frequency of sessions, and length of treatment period. Investigators will use fixed acupuncture protocols. Disposable, single-use, sterilized needles made of stainless steel, 0.25 x 30 mm and 0.30 x 40/50 mm (Hwoto, Suzhou Medical Appliance Fact. 215005 Suzhou, China) will be inserted to a depth of 15-35 mm in segmental acupuncture points located in abdominal and leg muscles with innervations corresponding to the ovaries. Two sets of acupuncture points will be alternated every second treatment. The first set consists of conception vessel (CV) 3, CV 12, and stomach (ST) 29 bilaterally and in the muscles above the knee, ST 34, and ST 33 bilaterally and below the knee, spleen (SP) 6 and ST 36. Needles will also be placed in extra segmental acupuncture points that do not innervate the ovaries large intestine (LI) 4 bilaterally. In total 14 needles will be placed and all will be stimulated manually by rotating the needle to evoke needle sensation (de qi) once when inserted. The following points will be connected to an electrical stimulator (Export Abteilung, Schwa-Medico GmbH, Wetzlarer Str. 41-43; 35630 Ehringshausen): CV 3 to CV 12, ST 29 bilateral, and ST34 to ST 33 bilateral. Stimulation are given as low-frequency EA of 2Hz, 0.3 ms pulse length and with an intensity adjusted to produce local muscle contractions without pain or discomfort. Needles not connected to the electrical stimulator will be manually stimulated to evoke needle sensation every 10 min, in total 4 times. The second set consists of 14 needles placed in segmental abdominal points and stimulated electrically: ST 27 bilaterally, CV6 connected to CV10; and leg points: SP10 connected to a non-acupuncture point located 6 cun proximal of patellas medial border (electrical stimulation), and SP 6 and liver (LR) 3 bilaterally (manual stimulation). Extra segmental points are pericardium (PC) 6 bilaterally (manual stimulation). 1.5.2 Needle insertion technique Needle insertion should be gentle. Tighten the skin by pressing around the area of needle insertion and gently insert the needle. Don't do it too quickly, be gentle. 1.5.3 Needles and stimulation Needles are for single use. Needle size: 0.25x30 mm or 0.30 x 40 or 0.30 x 50 mm. Select needle length with respect to the patients BMI. If the patient has a low BMI and is thin use the 0.25 x 30 mm needle. If the patient is overweight, use the 0.30 x 40 mm needles. Obese patients, use needle with the size 0.30 x 50 or 75 mm. Depth of insertion may vary from patient to patient. They should be placed with a depth deep enough to reach muscle/fibrous tissue. When needle are inserted, stimulate the needle gently until de qi (needle sensation reflecting activation of sensory afferents). As soon as de qi has been reached, make sure that the needle doesn't hurt or cause any pain and discomfort. Attach the electrodes according to the protocol. Turn on the stimulator (program 10) and increase the intensity. Instructions to the patient: ""As high as possible but with no pain or discomfort"". Don't start with too intensive stimulation. After 10 minutes, stimulate needles without electricity and ask if the intensity of the electrical stimulation is ok, or if it should be increased/decreased. Repeat after 20 minutes and again after 30 minutes. Turn off the stimulator and release the patient. 1.5.4 Acupuncture treatment 1. Record time of the day and acupuncturist name when the patient receives acupuncture. 2. Note the intensity of stimulation (mA). It may vary between the different electrodes. Note the range e.g. 1.2 - 3.0 mA. 3. Note any other events that may affect the treatment (positive or negative). 4. Note concomitant medications. 5. Collect menstrual and intercourse journal logs at the end of every cycle. 6. Check urine pregnancy test before each acupuncture treatment. If pregnancy test is positive, no acupuncture treatment should be performed. 1.5.5 Letrozole After 16 weeks of acupuncture pretreatment, which the patients in the intervention group and the patients in the control group will receive LE (Femara, Novartis Pharmaceuticals), starting from 2.5mg daily from day 2-3 for 5 days after a withdrawal bleeding. Participants are treated for up to 4 cycles. If the patient is pregnant, the treatment should be stopped. If there is evidence of ovulation (i.e. serum progesterone level on the 3th week was higher than 3 ng/mL) or delayed one week, this dose will be maintained. In patients with no ovulatory response, the dose will be increased to LE 5mg a day for five days until LE 7.5 mg per day for five days will be reached. The same LE dose will be continued in the next cycle if the patients are shown to be ovulating. And the maximum daily dose of LE is 7.5 mg (three pills) daily. 1.6 Monitoring and examination during the treatment And all subjects will be instructed to have intercourse on a regular basis during the entire study period. The optimal frequency will be once every 2-3 days. Urine pregnancy test will be checked before each acupuncture treatment of ovulation. And serum progesterone level test will be checked in the local lab at day on the 3th week of the first cycle and every week of the last three cycles. The transvaginal ultrasound exam will take place in the anticipated luteal phase of the cycle, and initially will be scheduled 3 weeks after the initiation of medication, with a window of 4 days on either side of this day (i.e. Day 17-25, assuming a Day 3 medication start, or Day 19-27, assuming a Day 5 start). The ultrasound includes the endometrial thickness and echogenicity, as well as the number, size, and echogenic characteristics of follicles/cysts on the ovary (including an antral follicle count). Investigators can decide whether the patients have the ovulation respond based on the results of serum progesterone level and transvaginal ultrasound. There will be three possible scenarios: ovulation, ovulation delay and non-ovulation. 1) Ovulation, i.e. serum progesterone level on the 3th week was higher than 3 ng/mL, and ultrasound may provide presumptive evidence of ovulation. Check urine pregnancy test to exclude pregnancy and start with LE tablet on day 3-5 of menstruation, and the dose of which will be maintained; 2) Ovulation delay, P\<3 ng/mL, but the ultrasound will show there is evidence of follicular development, (i.e. a follicle with a mean diameter ??2 mm). Investigators can wait for one more week and continue the acupuncture treatment. Check urine pregnancy test to exclude pregnancy and start with LE tablet on day 3-5 of menstruation, and the dose of which will be maintained; 3) Non-ovulation, P\<3 ng/mL, and the ultrasound will not found any follicle with a mean diameter ??2 mm. The patient will also receive LE tablet on day 3-5 of her cycle, and she will be instructed to increase her study drug by one tablet per day for five days. Every menstruation should be detailed recorded, including the date, volume and duration of menstruation. 1.7 End of pre-treatment visit 1) Repeat OGTT. 2) Collect menstrual journal logs. 1.8 Pregnancy visit(only with conception) 1. Complete adverse event query. 2. Take blood for serum quantitative hCG levels until the ultrasound can observe the gestational sacs (1500-2000IU/ml). 3. Perform transvaginal ultrasound for the number of gestational sacs, location, dimensions, presence and size of fetal parts, and documentation of visualization of fetal heart motion, documentation of any pregnancy related abnormalities when hCG levels or clinical manifestations appear as pregnancy. 1.9 End of treatment visit 1. Perform physical examination, including vital signs, height, weight, hip and waist measurements as well as repeating hirsutism and acne assessments after the end of treatment or pregnancy. 2. Repeat the serum levels of sex hormone steroids and metabolic profile. 3. Repeat OGTT. 4. Collect 20ml blood, and distributed store 10ml blood after serum separation. Other 10ml blood is for determination of DNA. 5. Repeat QOL, sleeping, anxiety/depression questionnaires, and the quantization table of TCM. 6. Collect menstrual and intercourse journal logs. 7. Record adverse events and concomitant medications. 8. Arrange follow up for subjects who have conceived and obtain release of records for pregnancy and neonatal records. 1.10 Follow up visit For those women who have an ongoing pregnancy, arrangements will be made to follow the outcome of the pregnancy at the end of first trimester and also after delivery or termination of gestation. All pregnancies (including multiples) will be followed to monitor the weight, glucose tolerance, blood pressure and fetal growth and to determine the abortion rate, complication rates and pregnancy outcomes. The glucose tolerance will be test by glucose screening test with 75 g glucose performed in all pregnancies at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy. Patients will be informed to notify study personnel of the outcome of the pregnancy and investigators will obtain release of record forms from treating physicians to obtain copies of relevant medical records. Delivery records of both mother and newborn will be requested to determine the birth weight, length of gestation, and any prenatal complication of mother or neonatal complication of the infant. Phone contacts will be initiated if the patient has not contacted study personnel by six weeks beyond the original estimated date of confinement. And investigators will collect pregnancy outcome data. Investigators will track the outcomes of all subjects who have a positive serum pregnancy screen during the course of this study. Investigators will record biochemical pregnancies (defined as positive serum pregnancy screens without ultrasonically detected pregnancies), ectopic pregnancies, and all intrauterine pregnancy losses both before and after 20 weeks including missed abortions, spontaneous abortions, elective abortions, fetal demises, and stillbirths. Investigators will review pregnancy and birth records of the mother and of the fetus to establish neonatal morbidity and mortality and the presence of fetal anomalies. Investigators will extract from these records concomitant medical and obstetrical conditions, exposure information on all other medical products used, including prescription products, over-the-counter (OTC) products, dietary supplements, vaccines, and insertable or implantable medical devices. Investigators will file individual case reports for all congenital anomalies, which will be considered a serious adverse event. 1.11 Safety analysis Adverse events will be categorized and percentage of patients experiencing adverse events and serious adverse events during the treatment period will be documented. Chi-square tests will be performed to examine differences in the proportion of total and categories of adverse events. 1.12 Statistical tests One sample of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be used to test the normal distribution of continuous variables. Continuous variables will be shown as means Â± standard deviations if they are normally distributed or as medians with interquartile ranges if they are not normally distributed. Statistical comparison will be carried out according to the intention to treat by Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Wilcoxon signed ranks test for continuous variables and by ?2 tests for categorical variables where appropriate. All statistical analyses of the data will be performed using the SPSS program version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and a P-value \< 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.",,,,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02491320,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=LNCT02491320&from=export,,"This record is sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, an official website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, and National Center for Biotechnology Information.

Investigators will also assess symptoms of anxiety and depression by the Zung SAS and Zung SDS questionnaires. And complete the quantization table of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes about PCOS. 1.4.3 Assess TCM syndromes of patients Syndrome differentiation (Bian Zheng) in TCM is the comprehensive analysis of clinical information gained by the four main diagnostic TCM procedures: observation, listening, questioning, and pulse analysis, and it is used to guide the choice of treatment either by acupuncture and/or TCM herbal formulae. In PCOS, patients are empirically differentiated to be four categories: 1) phlegm-dampness syndrome, 2) blood stasis syndrome, 3) phlegm, and 4) blood stasis. 2. Intervention arms 2.1 Information to all study subjects All participants will be advised about the importance of regular physical exercise and a balanced diet by a trained dietician. Importantly, they will be instructed not to change their exercise or diet habits during the entire study period. True acupuncture or, sham acupuncture and metformin/placebo will be started 2 days after the baseline visit including OGTT. All subjects will be asked to use a barrier method for contraception. True and sham acupuncture treatment will be given three times per week. Each treatment session lasts for 30 minutes and can be separated by an interval of 1-3 days, with a maximum of 90 treatment sessions during 4 month. After the third treatment, all patients fill in the expectation and credibility questionnaire. Metformin or placebo will be given at 0.5g/times, 3 times one day and for 4 month. 2.1.1 True acupuncture protocol The rationale of acupuncture protocols is based on Western Medical theories and the study protocol follows the CONSORT and STRICTA recommendations.Investigators will use fixed acupuncture protocols. The acupuncture protocol of this RCT follows the protocol in the following studies: ClinicalTrial.gov NCT01457209 and NCT02026323. Disposable, single-use, sterilized needles made of stainless steel, 0.25 x 30 mm and 0.30 x 40/50 mm (Hwoto, Suzhou Medical Appliance Fact. 215005 Suzhou, China) will be inserted to a depth of 15-35 mm in segmental acupuncture points located in abdominal and leg muscles with innervations corresponding to the ovaries. Two sets of acupuncture points will be alternated every second treatment. The first set consists of conception vessel (CV) 4, CV 12, and stomach (ST) 29 bilaterally and in the muscles above the knee, ST 34, and ST 32 bilaterally and below the knee, spleen (SP) 6 and ST 36. Needles will also be placed in extra segmental acupuncture points that do not innervate the ovaries large intestine (LI) 4 bilaterally. In total 14 needles will be placed and all will be stimulated manually by rotating the needle to evoke needle sensation (de qi) once when inserted. The following points will be connected to an electrical stimulator (Export Abteilung, Schwa-Medico GmbH,Wetzlarer Str. 41-43;35630 Ehringshausen): CV 4 to CV 12, ST 29 bilateral, ST34 to ST 32 bilateral. Stimulation are given as low-frequency EA of 2Hz, 0.3 ms pulse length and with an intensity adjusted to produce local muscle contractions without pain or discomfort. Needles not connected to the electrical stimulator will be manually stimulated to evoke needle sensation every 10 min, in total 4 times. The second set consists of 14 needles placed in segmental abdominal points and stimulated electrically: ST 27 bilaterally, CV6 connected to CV10; and leg points: SP10 connected to a non-acupuncture point located 6 cun proximal of patellas medial border (electrical stimulation), and SP 6 and liver (LR) 3 bilaterally (manual stimulation). Extra segmental points are pericardium (PC) 6 bilaterally (manual stimulation). 2.1.2 Needle insertion technique Needle insertion should be gentle. Tighten the skin by pressing around the area of needle insertion and gently insert the needle. 2.1.3 Needles and stimulation Needle size: 0.25 x 30 mm or 0.30 x 40 or 0.30 x 50 mm. Select needle length with respect to the patients'BMI: 0.25 x 30 mm needles in women with normal BMI; 0.30 x 40 mm needles in overweight women and 0.30 x 50 or 75 mm needles in obese women. Depth of insertion may vary from patients to patients. Needles are placed with a depth deep enough to reach muscle/fibrous tissue. When needle are inserted, stimulate the needle gently until de qi (needle sensation reflecting activation of sensory afferents). As soon as de qi has been reached, make sure that the needle does not hurt or cause any pain and discomfort. Manual stimulation of needles that is not attached to an electrical stimulator (see below) are stimulated when inserted, after 10 minutes, 20 minutes and immediately before they are removed after 30 minutes. Attach the electrodes according to the protocol. Turn on the stimulator (program 10) and increase the intensity. The intensity will be as high as possible without pain or discomfort. The stimulation amplitude/intensity will be adjusted after 10 and 20 minutes at the same time as when needle stimulated manually are manipulated. After 30 minutes the stimulator is turned off, electrodes disconnected and needles taken out. 2.1.4 Sham acupuncture protocol Disposable, single-use, sterilized needles made of stainless steel, 0.20 x 20 mm (Hwoto, Suzhou Medical Appliance Fact.215005 Suzhou, China) will be inserted superficially to a depth of \<5 mm, one in each shoulder and on in each upper arm at non-acupuncture points. Placement of needles is unlikely to affect ovulation and IR in women with PCOS. Electrodes will be attached to the needles and the stimulator will be turned on at an intensity of zero (no active current) in order to mimic EA in the acupuncture protocol. No manual stimulation of the needles will be performed. An intended adjustment of the intensity after 10 minutes, 20 minutes and again after 30 minutes when stimulator is turned off and needles removed. 2.1.5 True and sham acupuncture treatment 1. Time of the day and acupuncturist name when the patient receives acupuncture will be recorded. 2. The intensity of stimulation (mA) is noted. It may vary between different electrodes. Note the range e.g. 1.2 - 3.0 mA. 3. Note any other events that may affect the treatment (positive or negative). 4. Note concomitant medications. 5. Collect menstrual logs at the end of every cycle. 2.2 Metformin and placebo Metformin (Kombiglyze XR) and placebo metformin will be packed and tested by a commercial pharmacy supply company (Squibb Company, Shanghai, China) specifically for this study. Metformin or placebo will be started 2 days after baseline visit including OGTT. Subjects will take 0.5 g/times, 3 times one day for up to 6 cycles. 2.3 Monitoring and examination during the treatment Physical examination will be performed monthly. Every menstruation should be recorded, including the date, volume and duration of menstruation during the entire study and follow-up. The condition of physical exercise and diet will be recorded for every cycle. OGTT will be repeated in the third month during the treatment. 2.4 End of treatment visit During the end of treatment visit will all baseline measures be repeated as listed below: 1. Perform physical examination, including vital signs, height, weight, hip and waist measurements as well as repeating hirsutism and acne assessments after the end of treatment or pregnancy. 2. Repeat the serum levels of sex hormone steroids and metabolic profile. 3. Repeat transvaginal ultrasound of ovarian morphology. 4. Repeat OGTT. 5. Collect 20ml blood, and distributed store 10ml blood after serum separation. Other 10ml blood is for determination of DNA and sphingolipid. 6. Repeat QOL, sleeping, IPAQ anxiety/depression questionnaires, and the quantization table of TCM. 7. Collect menstrual logs. 8. Record adverse events and concomitant medications. 9. Answer the two questions about acupuncture treatment. 2.5 Follow-up visit Baseline and end of treatment visit will be repeated 3 months after last treatment (see point 1-8 under End of treatment visit). All the participants will be followed up with visiting the acupuncturists monthly for 3 month. The condition of physical exercise and diet will be record every month. 2.6 Safety analysis Adverse events will be categorized and percentage of patients experiencing adverse events and serious adverse events during the treatment period and follow up period will be documented. Chi-square tests will be performed to examine differences in the proportion of total and categories of adverse events. 2.7 Statistics One sample of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be used to test the normal distribution of continuous variables. Continuous variables will be presented as means Â± standard deviations if they are normally distributed or as medians with interquartile ranges if they are not normally distributed.

Evaluating practitioner-blinding in chinese herbal medicine research: Findings from a randomised feasibility study in the United Kingdom,"Lai L., Flower A., Prescott P., Moore M., Lewith G.","Purpose: Practitioner-blinding is often carried out in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) yet evaluation of blinding is infrequently conducted. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of practitioner-blinding within a UK study and identify reasons for practitioner guesses. Methods: We conducted a practitioner and patient-blind feasibility study exploringCHMfor polycystic ovary syndrome, randomising 40 women to standardised CHM or individualised CHM for 24 weeks. We evaluated practitioner-blinding at Week 4, 12 and End of Study (EoS). This questionnaire invited a treatment allocation guess (Standardised/Individualised) and certainty rating (Not at all sure, just guessed/Fairly sure/Entirely sure). This was used to calculate a Bang Blinding Index (BBI). The final item asked for reasons for their answer, analysed using content analysis. Results: Completion rates of blinding-questionnaire was excellent (mean=86%). Practitioner-guessing and BBI at Week 4 was standardised random/individualised unblinded (standardised -0.11,95%CI -0.35 to 0.14; individualised 0.47,95%CI 0.2 3 to 0.71), at Week 12 standardised random/individualised unblinded (standardised -0.24,95%CI -0.54 to 0.07; individualised 0.50,95%CI 0.12 to 0.88); EoS standardised opposite/ individualised unblinded (standardised -0.56,95%CI -0.9 1 to -0.20; individualised 0.61,95%CI 0.30 to 0.92). 'Presence of effects' was the highest ranking reason for treatment guess (52% of responses) and consistently led to a guess of 'individualised treatment'/'not at all sure', and 'absence of effect' consistently led to a guess of 'standardised treatment'/'not at all sure'. This can be interpreted as 'wishful thinking' scenario whereby the practitioner consistently believed treatment response was due to individualised treatment, suggesting that blinding was likely secure. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that practitionerblinding is feasible and likely secure in this feasibility study. To our knowledge, this is the first time practitioner-blinding has been rigorously evaluated in a CHM study in the UK. Qualitative data has provided further insight into practitioner reasons for treatment guess which will be used to maximise practitioner-blinding in future studies.",,,10.1016/j.imr.2015.04.310,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2015.04.310,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L71932249&from=export,,"Copyright 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Chinese herbal medicine for oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea in polycystic ovary syndrome: A randomised feasibility study in the United Kingdom,"Lai L., Flower A., Prescott P., Moore M., Lewith G.","Purpose: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 6-18% of women of reproductive-age and oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoe are cardinal symptoms. Conventional management is associated with side-effects and anecdotal evidence suggests Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) can help. Individualised CHM is regarded as more effective than standardised, but requires in vestigation in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). This study explores the feasibility of conducting an RCT comparing standardised and individualisedCHMfor regulating menses in PCOS. Methods: This pragmatic, practitioner-blinded feasibility study randomised 40 PCOS participants with oligo- or amenorrhoea into 2 parallel groups - standardised or individualised CHM - prescribed at 16 g granules/day as a tea for 6 months. Our primary aim was to evaluate feasibility of offering standardised and individualised CHM within an RCT and collect menstrual data for sample size calculation. Secondary data included body mass index, weight, hirsutism and safety data on liver/kidney function and adverse events. Results: 40 women were recruited within our planned 7- month recruitment-period. 29 participants (72.5%) completed the study, 3 were lost-to-follow-up (7.5%) and 8 withdrew (20%). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of menstrual rate per month showed statistically significant improvements in standardised CHM (MD 0.18Â±SE0.06, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.29) and in individualised CHM (MD 0.27Â±SE0.07, 95%CI 0.15 to 0.39). This did not reach between-group statistical significance (MD 0.10Â±SE0.08, 95%CI -0.07 to 0.26, p=0.26). ANCOVA of secondary measures suggest no important changes in body mass index or weight. Liver/kidney function at Week 4 was normal (n=35), abnormal ALT (n=1); at final visit was normal (n=30), abnormal (n=0). The case of abnormal ALT was later confirmed an acute response to alcohol. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that a CHM RCT for PCOS is feasible and preliminary data suggests promising menstrual response in both groups. This data will be used to inform sample-size calculation and design of a main study that will incorporate an active or placebo-control.",,,10.1016/j.imr.2015.04.324,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2015.04.324,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L71932260&from=export,,"Copyright 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Treatment adherence in Chinese herbal medicine: Findings from a randomised feasibility study in the United Kingdom,"Lai L., Flower A., Prescott P., Moore M., Lewith G.","Purpose: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluate effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) in the West, yet little is known regarding CHM adherence amongst these populations. We aimed to evaluate feasibility of collecting adherence data within a UK study and identify strategies for improving adherence. Methods: We conducted a feasibility study exploring CHM for polycystic ovary syndrome, randomising 40 women to either standardised CHM or individualised CHM. This was prescribed for 24 weeks at 8 g granules/dose, two dosages daily, taken as a tea. Practitioners and participants were blinded. We evaluated adherence using Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) at Week 4 and end of study (EoS); weighing prescriptions at Week 12 and EoS, and process data. Results: Mean completion rates were high for MMAS (87.5%). Weighing data was complete for 15 (37.5%) participants, incomplete for 15 (37.5%) and absent for 10 (25%). MMAS data suggests low adherence to both CHM interventions at Week 4 and EoS. Small improvements within-group were observed for both standardised CHM (MD 0.9, 95% CI - 0.3 to 2.0) and individualised CHM (MD 1.0, 95% CI 0. 3 to 1.8) but which were statistically significant only for individualised. When explored as a categorical variable, improvement from low to medium or high adherence was found in 4 participants from each of the two groups. We used weighing data to estimate a mean of 65% (SD21.2) of CHMs were administered, suggesting a dose of 10-11 g/day is more feasible. Process data suggests adherence could be improved by changing administration to tablet/capsules and reducing to once daily dosing. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous evaluation of CHM treatment adherence carried out in the UK. This study has uncovered important findings regarding CHM adherence in a Western population and will help inform the design of the CHM intervention for a main study.",,,10.1016/j.imr.2015.04.235,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2015.04.235,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L71932523&from=export,,"Copyright 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Infertility in polycystic ovary syndrome treated with acupuncture and clomiphene: a randomized controlled trial,"Jiang D., Zhang Y., Wu X., Wu S.","OBJECTIVE: To explore the best therapy for infertility caused by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients were randomized into three groups, a clomi-phene group (group A), an acupuncture-moxibustion + Chinese medicine group (group B) and a clomiphene + acupuncture-moxibustion+ Chinese medicine group (group C), 40 cases in each one. In the group A, since the 5th day of menstruation, clomiphene was prescribed for oral administration. In the group B, on the 5th day of menstruation, warm needling therapy was applied at Zhongji (CV 3), Guanyuan (CV 4), Guilai (ST 29), etc. Additionally, the Chinese herbal medication for tonifying the kidney and activating blood circulation was provided. In the group C, the therapy as the group B was combined on the basis of the treatment as the group A. The treatment lasted continuously for 3 menstrual cycles. The endometrial thickness, endometrial type and cervical mucus score on human chorionic gon adotropin (HCG) day, and ovulatory cycle rate, clinical pregnancy rate and abortion rate after treatment were observed in the patients of the three groups.RESULTS: 1) HCG day cervical mucus score, endometrial thickness and endometrial morphology (A type rate): the results in the group C were better than those in the group A (all P<0.01); the results in the group B were better than those in the group A (all P<0.05). The difference in the endometrial thickness was not significant in comparison between the group C and the group B (P>0.05). The cervical mucus score and endometrial morphology (A type rate) in the group C were better than those in the group B (both P<0.05). 2) The ovulatory cycle rates in the group A and group (C were higher than that in the group B (both P<0.05), the pregnancy rate in the group C was higher than that in the other groups (both P<0.05), and the early abortion rate in the group C was lower than that in the group A and group B (both P<0.01). 3) Follicle diameter from 18 mm to 20 mm and endometrial thickness: the differences were not significant between the normal pregnancy patients and the early abortion patients (both P>0.05). The endometrial morphology A type rate in the normal pregnancy patients was higher than that in the early abortion patients (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: The combined therapy of acupuncture, herbal medicine and clomiphene improves the pregnancy rate and reduces early abortion rate by effectively improving HCG day cervical mucus, endometrial thickness and morphology. The efficacy is apparently superior to the simple medication with clomiphene and the combined application of acupuncture and herbal medicine.","chorionic gonadotropin (9002-61-3), clomifene (911-45-5)",,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L604273548&from=export,,Copyright 2015 Medline is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.
Chinese herbal medicine for female infertility: An updated meta-analysis,Ried K.,"Objectives: To assess the effect of Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in the management of female infertility and on pregnancy rates compared with Western medical (WM) treatment and update previous meta-analyses. Methods: We searched the Medline and Cochrane databases until December 2013 for randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses investigating Chinese herbal medicine therapy for female infertility and compared clinical pregnancy rates achieved with CHM versus WM drug treatment. Results: Forty RCTs involving 4247 women with infertility were included in our systematic review. Meta-analysis suggested a 1.74 higher probability of achieving a pregnancy with CHM therapy than with WM therapy alone (risk ratio 1.74, 95%CI: 1.56-1.94; p<. 0.0001; odds ratio 3.14; 95%CI: 2.72-3.62; p<. 0.0001) in women with infertility. Trials included women with PCOS, endometriosis, anovulation, fallopian tube blockage, or unexplained infertility. Mean pregnancy rates in the CHM group were 60% compared with 33% in the WM group. Conclusions: Our review suggests that management of female infertility with Chinese herbal medicine can improve pregnancy rates 2-fold within a 3-6 month period compared with Western medical fertility drug therapy. In addition, fertility indicators such as ovulation rates, cervical mucus score, biphasic basal body temperature, and appropriate thickness of the endometrial lining were positively influenced by CHM therapy, indicating an ameliorating physiological effect conducive for a viable pregnancy.","alpha tocopherol (1406-18-4, 1406-70-8, 52225-20-4, 58-95-7, 59-02-9), chorionic gonadotropin (9002-61-3), clomifene (911-45-5), clomifene citrate (50-41-9), cyproterone acetate plus ethinylestradiol (60528-19-0), danazol (17230-88-5), gestrinone (16320-04-0), human menopausal gonadotropin (61489-71-2), medroxyprogesterone (520-85-4), prednisolone (50-24-8), tamoxifen (10540-29-1)",,10.1016/j.ctim.2014.12.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2014.12.004,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L601454738&from=export,,"Copyright 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Chinese herbal medicine alleviating hyperandrogenism of pcos rats through regulating pparg1 and hdac3 expression in the ovaries,"Gu Y.-E., Wang F.-F., Yang D.-X., Zhou J., Ye Y.-H., Zhu Y.-H., Jiang D., Qu F.","Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women hence Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been chosen by many clinicians and patients as alternative treatment for PCOS. The present study was to explore the effects of CHM in alleviating hyperandrogenism of PCOS rats induced by testosterone propionate and the possible underlying mechanism. Materials and methods: A total of forty female Sprague?“Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal control group, PCOS model group, CHM1 group and CHM2 group, with ten rats in each group. The rat models with PCOS were established by single injection of testosterone propionate at the 9th day after birth. The status of estrous cyclicity for each rat was observed. After the treatment for 12 weeks ended, the serum levels of total testosterone (TT), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), androstenedione, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) of the rats were measured with ELISA and mRNA expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 1(PPARG1) and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in the ovaries of the rats were detected with real-time quantitative PCR. Results: The serum levels of LH/FSH, FAI and androstenedione of the PCOS model rats were the highest among all the groups (P<0.05) and no significant differences on the serum levels of LH/FSH and FAI between the rats from CHM1 and CHM2 groups were found (P>0.05). The serum levels of androstenedione of the rats from CHM1 group were significantly lower than those of CHM2 group (P<0.05). In the ovaries of PCOS model rats, PPARG1mRNA expression levels were significantly lower, and HDAC3 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher than the other three groups (P<0.05). There were no significant differences existed between CHM1 and CHM2 groups on mRNA expression levels of PPARG1 and HDAC3 in the ovaries of the rats(P>0.05). Conclusion: It is through regulating PPARG1 and HDAC3 expression levels in the ovaries that CHM significantly alleviates hyperandrogenism of PCOS rats induced by testosterone propionate.","androstenedione (26264-53-9, 63-05-8), follitropin (9002-68-0), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), testosterone (58-22-0), testosterone propionate (57-85-2)",,10.4314/ajtcam.v12i2.2,http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/ajtcam.v12i2.2,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L605253108&from=export,,"Copyright 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Herbal medicine for the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and associated oligo/amenorrhoea and hyperandrogenism; a review of the laboratory evidence for effects with corroborative clinical findings,"Arentz S., Abbott J.A., Smith C.A., Bensoussan A.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent, complex endocrine disorder characterised by polycystic ovaries, chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism leading to symptoms of irregular menstrual cycles, hirsutism, acne and infertility. Evidence based medical management emphasises a multidisciplinary approach for PCOS, as conventional pharmaceutical treatment addresses single symptoms, may be contra-indicated, is often associated with side effects and not effective in some cases. In addition women with PCOS have expressed a strong desire for alternative treatments. This review examines the reproductive endocrine effects in PCOS for an alternative treatment, herbal medicine. The aim of this review was to identify consistent evidence from both pre-clinical and clinical research, to add to the evidence base for herbal medicine in PCOS (and associated oligo/amenorrhoea and hyperandrogenism) and to inform herbal selection in the provision clinical care for these common conditions. Methods: We undertook two searches of the scientific literature. The first search sought pre-clinical studies which explained the reproductive endocrine effects of whole herbal extracts in oligo/amenorrhoea, hyperandrogenism and PCOS. Herbal medicines from the first search informed key words for the second search. The second search sought clinical studies, which corroborated laboratory findings. Subjects included women with PCOS, menstrual irregularities and hyperandrogenism. Results: A total of 33 studies were included in this review. Eighteen pre-clinical studies reported mechanisms of effect and fifteen clinical studies corroborated pre-clinical findings, including eight randomised controlled trials, and 762 women with menstrual irregularities, hyperandrogenism and/or PCOS. Interventions included herbal extracts of Vitex agnus-castus, Cimicifuga racemosa, Tribulus terrestris, Glycyrrhiza spp., Paeonia lactiflora and Cinnamomum cassia. Endocrine outcomes included reduced luteinising hormone (LH), prolactin, fasting insulin and testosterone. There was evidence for the regulation of ovulation, improved metabolic hormone profile and improved fertility outcomes in PCOS. There was evidence for an equivalent effect of two herbal medicines and the pharmaceutical agents bromocriptine (and Vitex agnus-castus) and clomiphene citrate (and Cimicifuga racemosa). There was less robust evidence for the complementary combination of spirinolactone and Glycyrrhiza spp. for hyperandrogenism. Conclusions: Preclinical and clinical studies provide evidence that six herbal medicines may have beneficial effects for women with oligo/amenorrhea, hyperandrogenism and PCOS. However the quantity of pre-clinical data was limited, and the quality of clinical evidence was variable. Further pre-clinical studies are needed to explain the effects of herbal medicines not included in this review with current clinical evidence but an absence of pre-clinical data.","bromocriptine (25614-03-3), clomifene citrate (50-41-9), insulin (9004-10-8), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), prolactin (12585-34-1, 50647-00-2, 9002-62-4), spironolactone (52-01-7), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.1186/1472-6882-14-511,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-511,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L605499932&from=export,,"Copyright 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Chinese herbal medicine and polycystic ovary syndrome: A randomized feasibility and pilot study in the United Kingdom,"Lai L., Flower A., Moore M., Lewith G.","Purpose: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common female endocrine disorder, affecting 6-18% of women of reproductive age. Though anecdotal evidence exists supporting the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for PCOS, this requires rigorous investigation. This study aims to explore the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical study involving CHM for PCOS in the United Kingdom (UK) and to pilot and evaluate study procedures. Methods: This is a prospective, practitioner and patient-blinded study, randomizing 40 PCOS patients aged 18-44 with oligo- or amenorrhoea into 2 parallel groups - standardized or individualised CHM formulations. Both groups will be prescribed granulated formulations at a dose of 8g twice daily (16g per day) for 6 months. The primary outcome measure is menstrual regularity; Secondary measures are body mass index, waist hip ratio, hirsutism and quality of life measures such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Questionnaire and Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile. Other data include liver and kidney function, compliance and practitioner-blinding. Feasibility outcomes include suitability of primary outcome measure for main study, recruitment rate and acceptability of interventions. Study procedures will be piloted such as randomization, data collection and double-blinding. Results: Of 245 enquiries, 40 patients with PCOS (16.3%) were recruited between January 2013 and August 2013 with a mean age of 29.4 years (range 19-44). Presently, 10 (25%) have completed the study and 7 withdrawn (17.5%) due to: pregnancy (n = 2), taste (n = 3) and adverse events (n = 2). As the last participant visit is expected in February 2014, pilot and process evaluation data will be presented. Conclusion: At the end of this study, the potential for both standardized and individualised CHM will be explored. The feasibility and pilot data will help determine whether further research by progressing to an adequately powered definitive RCT is warranted.",,,10.1089/acm.2014.5159,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/acm.2014.5159,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L71474759&from=export,,"Copyright 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Chinese herbal medicine for oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea in polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Lai L., Li X., Flower A., Moore M., Liu J., Lewith G.","Purpose: Oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea are cardinal symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common female endocrine disorder affecting 6-18% of women of reproductive age. Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have explored the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for PCOS, this requires rigorous investigation. Our aim was to evaluate the evidence on CHM for PCOS-related oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search using international and Chinese language electronic databases from their date of inception to June 2011 and grey literature search. RCTs were assessed for eligibility and data extracted independently by two reviewers. Study authors were contacted where eligibility remained unclear. Results: 4 RCTs involving 246 participants were eligible. Pooled analysis was not possible for our primary measure of menstrual cyclicity, reported in one study to show a significantly greater number of responders with CHM plus Diane-35 (n = 13), compared with Diane-35 only (n = 5) (RR2.60, 95%CI 1.06 to 6.39, p = 0.04). Pooled analysis showed significant reduction in total testosterone favoring CHM plus Diane-35 over Diane-35 alone (MD - 0.69, 95%CI - 0.72 to - 0.66, p < 0.00001), and in luteinising hormone (LH) (MD-2.24, 95%CI - 3.03 to - 1.46, p < 0.00001). Compared with conventional medicine alone, CHM alone showed significantly greater reduction in total testosterone (MD-0.45, 95%CI - 0.63 to - 0.28, p < 0.0001) and no significant between-group difference in LH reduction (MD-0.62, 95%CI - 1.80 to - 0.55, p = 0.30). Two studies reported fewer adverse events with CHM. One study reported no change in liver function with CHM plus Diane-35 or Diane-35 alone. All studies were rated as being at high risk of bias. Conclusion: Although preliminary evidence suggests CHM may help regulate menses and correct endocrine abnormalities in PCOS, these results should be interpreted with caution owing to the small number of studies and high risk of bias found.

A total of 31 articles (28 in Chinese, 3 in English) containing 2,321 cases of PCOS patients met the included criteria. Meta-analysis showed that the clinical efficacy of simple acupuncture was the same as that of western medicine, and the efficacy of acupuncture combined with Chinese herbal medicine interventions was obviously higher than that of western medicine (P < 0.05). In addition, simple acupuncture intervention and acupuncture combined with Chinese herbal medicines or with moxibustion treatment have advantages in reducing serum luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone (LH/FSH), insulin resistance (IR), testosterone (T), and body mass index (BMI). However, the quality of the collected articles is generally lower due to unclear bias, no sample quantity estimation, incorrect randomization methods, no follow-up survey, etc. Acupuncture therapy may be effective for PCOS, but needs to be confirmed further by larger sample randomized controlled trials.",,,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L373793901&from=export,,Copyright 2014 Medline is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.

Cryptotanshinone reverses ovarian insulin resistance in mice through activation of insulin signaling and the regulation of glucose transporters and hormone synthesizing enzymes,"Huang Y., Li W., Wang C.C., Wu X., Zheng J.","Objective To investigate the effects of cryptotanshinone (CRY), an active component of Chinese medicine, on ovarian androgen production, insulin resistance (IR), and glucose metabolism in mice. Design Animal model and in vitro tissue model. Setting University-affiliated laboratory. Animal(s) Mice. Intervention(s) Ovarian IR was induced by dexamethasone (DEX) in vivo. Animals were randomized to receive CRY treatment for 3 days or not. Ovulation rates, serum steroid levels, and glucose uptake in ovaries were quantified, and proteins in the phosphatidylinositol 3-hydroxy kinase pathway were measured. In vitro ovarian IR was also induced by DEX for 3 days. Ovarian steroid hormone secretion and glucose uptake were measured, and the hormone-synthesizing enzymes were determined by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Main Outcome Measure(s) Ovarian glucose uptake, in vivo ovulation rate, serum and culture medium steroid level, and molecular expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-hydroxy kinase and steroidogenic enzymes. Result(s) Dexamethasone significantly increased ovulation rates in vivo and increased T and E(2) production and decreased ovarian glucose uptake in vivo and in vitro. Cryptotanshinone significantly reduced ovulation rates in vivo and decreased T and estrogen production in vitro. Cryptotanshinone attenuated the inhibition of DEX on AKT2 and suppressed the up-regulation of CYP11 and CYP17 expression by DEX. Conclusion(s) Cryptotanshinone reversed DEX-induced androgen excess and ovarian IR in mice through activation of insulin signaling and the regulation of glucose transporters and hormone-synthesizing enzymes. This suggests a potential role for CRY in treating the ovulatory dysfunction associated with PCOS.

"Letrozole, berberine, or their combination for anovulatory infertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: Study design of a doubleblind randomised controlled trial","Li Y., Kuang H., Shen W., Ma H., Zhang Y., Stener-Victorin E., Ng E.H.Y., Liu J., Kuang H., Hou L., Wu X.","Introduction: Letrozole is being used as an alternative to clomiphene citrate in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) requiring ovulation induction. Berberine, a major active component of Chinese herbal medicine rhizoma coptidis, has been used to improve insulin resistance to facilitate ovulation induction in women with PCOS but there is no study reporting the live birth or its potential as a complementary treatment to letrozole. We aim to determine the efficacy of letrozole with or without berberine in achieving live births among 660 infertile women with PCOS in Mainland China. Methods and analysis: This study is a multicentre randomised, double-blind trial. The randomisation scheme is coordinated through the central mechanism and stratified by the participating site. Participants are randomised into one of the three treatment arms: (1) letrozole and berberine, (2) letrozole and berberine placebo, or (3) letrozole placebo and berberine. Berberine is administered three times a day (1.5 g/day) for up to 24 weeks, starting on day 1 after a spontaneous period or a withdrawal bleeding. Either letrozole or letrozole placebo 2.5 mg is given daily from day 3 to day 7 of the first three cycles and the dose is increased to 5 mg/day in the last three cycles, if not pregnant. The primary hypothesis is that the combination of berberine and letrozole results in a significantly higher live birth rate than letrozole or berberine alone.

Effects of acupuncture on the outcome of in vitro fertilisation and intracytoplasmic sperm injection in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.,"Rashidi B.H., Tehrani E.S., Hamedani N.A., Pirzadeh L.","Different mechanisms have been described for the effects of acupuncture on fertility. Acupuncture may mediate neurotransmitter release, which results in the stimulation of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone secretion. The production of neurotransmitters such as endogenous opioids may also inhibit central nervous system outflow and biological stress response. Acupuncture may also stimulate blood flow to the uterus by inhibiting uterine central sympathetic nerve activity. Despite some evidence suggesting beneficial effects of acupuncture on in vitro fertilisation (IVF) success rates, recent clinical trials could not duplicate these effects, especially in patients who are infertile with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) who are undergoing IVF. A total of 62 women with PCOS undergoing IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) at Shayamehr IVF Clinic in Tehran (Iran) participated in a randomised, controlled trial. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups: there were 31 women each in the acupuncture (group I) and control groups (group II). Acupuncture based on traditional Chinese medicine was performed in group I versus no adjunctive treatment in group II. All acupuncture procedures were performed in five sessions: start of downregulation, start of stimulation, 2 days before ovum pick-up, and immediately before and after embryo transfer. We measured the rate of oocytes in metaphase II, the fertilisation rate and the quality of embryos. Our results showed a statistically higher mean of good quality embryos in group I compared with group II (p=0.044). However, the mean number of metaphase II oocytes retrieved and fertilisation rate were similar between the two groups. We also could not find any significant differences among clinical, biochemical or ongoing pregnancy rates. Acupuncture at an early stage of oocyte recruitment may have a beneficial effect on embryo quality. However, it seems to have no significant effect on other IVF/ICSI outcomes of women with PCOS.

[Comparative study on Chinese medical syndrome typing and treatment combined different surgical methods for treating clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome].,"Zeng L., Zeng C., Tao L.L.","To observe the therapeutic efficacy of Chinese medical syndrome typing and treatment combined cold needle puncture drainage operation or unipolar electrocoagulation drilling technique under laparoscope for treating clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Forty infertility patients with clomiphene-resistant PCOS were assigned to two groups using stratified random sampling method according to age, infertility time, and body mass index, 20 in each group. Patients in Group A were treated with Chinese medical syndrome typing and treatment combined cold needle puncture drainage operation, while those in Group B were treated with Chinese medical syndrome typing and treatment combined unipolar electrocoagulation drilling technique. After operation Chinese herbal treatment was administered to all patients according to syndrome typing. The serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), androgen (T), estradiol (E2), and prolactin (PRL) were determined before and after operation. The ovulation was monitored. The pregnancy rate and the pregnancy outcomes were recorded after operation. There was no statistical difference in the 3-month spontaneous ovulation rate or the 1-year pregnancy rate (P > 0.05). The levels of LH, T, and PRL were significantly lower after operation than before operation in the two groups (P < 0.05). The menstruation and ovulation were obviously improved after operation.

Developing good practice guidelines in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome with Chinese herbal medicine: A Delphi study,"Lai L., Flower A., Lewith G., Moore M.","Purpose: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common female endocrine disorder, affecting 6-18% of women of reproductive age. Irregular periods are a hallmark symptom of PCOS and whilst Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has historically been used as an effective treatment for irregular periods, this requires further investigation in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). To ensure that the methods used within an RCT reflects Chinese herbal methods used in clinical practice, a study was proposed to establish good practice guidelines in the treatment of PCOS through achieving consensus amongst a group of Chinese medicine herbalists. Methods: The Delphi method was used involving in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of 11 expert Chinese medicine herbalists. Interview data was analysed using thematic and framework analysis to formulate Delphi questionnaire items. Experts were then distributed the questionnaire online and asked to rate their agreement with each questionnaire item on a 7-point Likert scale. Consensus was defined a priori as a mean Likert scale score of 5 or more. Questionnaire items not reaching consensus were re-distributed to experts for re-consideration via a second and a third and final round of questionnaires where necessary. Results: Preliminary results suggest that consensus exists amongst experts regarding common diagnostic categories, treatment strategies used, appropriate dosage and appropriate duration of treatment to observe a clinical effect. Conclusion: The preliminary results suggest that consensus can be achieved at least within the core aspects of Chinese herbal medicine treatment for PCOS. This methodology is vital in the development of rigorous RCTs for CHM and the outcome and principles of good practice guidelines for PCOS will be presented at the conference.",,,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L70907715&from=export,,"Copyright 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
A clinical study on the short-term effect of berberine in comparison to metformin on the metabolic characteristics of women with polycystic ovary syndrome,"Wei W., Zhao H., Wang A., Sui M., Liang K., Deng H., Ma Y., Zhang Y., Zhang H., Guan Y.","Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a frequent reproductive and metabolic disorder associated with insulin resistance (IR). Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline derivative alkaloid extracted from Chinese medicinal herbs that has been used as an insulin sensitizer. BBR may have a potential therapeutic value for PCOS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of BBR in comparison to metformin (MET) on the metabolic features of women with PCOS. Design and methods: Eighty-nine subjects with PCOS and IR subjects were randomized into one of three treatment groups: BBR+compound cyproterone acetate (CPA; n = 31), MET+CPA (n =3 0), and placebo+CPA (n = 28) for 3 months. Clinical characteristics of the women and metabolic and hormonal parameters were assessed before and after the period of treatment. Results: Treatment with BBR in comparison to MET showed decrease in waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; P < 0.01), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC; P < 0.05) as well as increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG; P < 0.05). Similarly, treatment with BBR in comparison to placebo showed decrease in WHR, fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment for IR, area under the curve of insulin, TC, LDLC, and TG (P < 0.05) as well as increase in HDLC and SHBG (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Intake of BBR improved some of the metabolic and hormonal derangements in a group of treated Chinese women with PCOS. Main effects could be related to the changes in body composition in obesity and dyslipidemia. Further controlled studies are needed for the assessment of the potential favorable metabolic effects of BBR in women with PCOS.

Is there any role for acupuncture in infertility treatment?,Moradan S.,"Background: Acupuncture is one of the most popular forms of alternative medicine used in the treatment of infertility. But what is acupuncture? Can it really help to get pregnant? Acupuncture involves placing hair-thin needles into particular points in the body. According to traditional Chinese medicine, these points run along ?œenergy lines??called meridians. By needling specific points, acupuncture is said to regulate the body's hormones and organs. Whether or not acupuncture can improve pregnancy rates is controversial. Some research studies have shown promise, while others have found no link between acupuncture treatment and improved pregnancy rates. The only thing just about everyone agrees on is that acupuncture can increase relaxation, help with pain, and lower stress levels. Given the stress of infertility, acupuncture may be worth a shot. No one is certain how acupuncture works, but there are theories. Materials and Methods: In this review article it was decided to search in internet about the acupuncture and its role in infertility and this review summarizes the recent studies which investigated the role of acupuncture in infertility the search was performed with key word of acupuncture and infertility and there were about 68 papers in regard to the acupuncture and infertility. Results: About the mechanism of acupuncture there is one theory says that by needling points on the body, chemicals and hormones are triggered and released. These chemicals either change the experience of pain, or they trigger a cascade of chemicals and hormones which influence the body's own internal regulating system. The improved energy flow and biochemical balance produced by acupuncture stimulates the body's natural healing abilities, and enhances physical and emotional well-being. Research has shown specifically that acupuncture increases the amount of beta-endorphins flowing through the body. Beta-endorphins Are feel-good hormones that help lessen pain. Exercise is also known to boost the amount of beta-endorphins in the body. The research on acupuncture and infertility is ongoing, and the topic is controversial. Some studies have been too small to prove a definitive connection to improved pregnancy rates, and some studies contradict each other in their results. With that said, here are a few of possible benefits of acupuncture, according to the preliminary research: Improved pregnancy rates during IVF treatment cycles, when acupuncture takes place on the day of embryo transfer Increased blood flow to the uterus, leading to an improved endometrial lining Reduced stress and anxiety levels Possible improvement in ovulation for women with PCOS Possible improvement in sperm count and quality in men with infertility. Possible regulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which in turn could help regulate ovulation. Conclusion: Even though a positive effect of acupuncture in infertility has been found, well-designed multicenter, prospective randomized controlled studies are still needed to provide more reliable and valid scientific evidence. Furthermore, it is urgent and necessary to clarify the mechanism of acupuncture for infertility.",,,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L71791572&from=export,,"Copyright 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Combination of acupuncture and chinese medicinal herbs in treating model rats with polycystic ovary syndrome.,"Ma R.J., Zhou J., Fang J.Q., Yang D.H., Qu F.","We explored the effects of combination of acupuncture and Chinese medicinal herbs in treating model rats with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and to explore whether acupuncture has positive effects on the absorption of salvianolic acid B in the extracts of a Chinese medicine formula when treating the model rats. 60 female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into Groups A, B, C, D, E and F, with ten rats in each group. Except Group F, all of the other rats were induced to PCOS with oral administration of letrozole. The rats in Group F served as normal controls. Group A was treated with acupuncture. Group B was treated with oral administration of the extracts of the Chinese medicine formula. Group C was treated with a combination of oral administration of the extracts of Chinese medicine and acupuncture. Group D received western medicine as positive controls. After treatment, the serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone(LH) and testosterone (T) in each group were detected with the Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) and the serum concentration of salvianolic acid B were determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The serum levels of T and the ratio of LH/FSH in Group A, B. C, D, and F were significantly lower than those of Group E, indicating the model rats with PCOS were successfully established. Compared with Groups A, B, D and E, the serum levels of T and the ratio of LH/FSH in Group C were significantly lower respectively, indicating combination of acupuncture and Chinese medicinal herbs can significantly enhance curative effects in treating model rats with PCOS. The concentration of serum salvianolic acid Group C was significantly higher than Group B, indicating that acupuncture might improve the absorption of salvianolic acid B from the extracts of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge in the Chinese medicine formula.

Rosiglitazone versus metformin for polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review,"Du Q., Yang S., Wu B., Han P.","Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rosiglitazone versus metformin in treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about rosiglitazone versus metformin in treating PCOS were retrieved on computer in MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, EMbase, EBSCO, CBM, CNKI, Chinese Medical Association Journal Database and VIP from the date of their establishment to December 2010. The trials were screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria by two reviewers independently, the data were extracted, the methodological quality was assessed, and finally meta-analysis was conducted with Stata 11.0 software. Results A total of six RCTs involving 286 PCOS patients were included. The results of meta-analyses showed that there was no significant difference between rosiglitazone and metformin in improving PCOS patients' insulin sensitivity (SMD= -0.14, 95%CI -0.46 to 0.19, P=0.412) and lowering androgen levels (SMD=0.05, 95%CI -0.26 to 0.36, P=0.747). However, the effect of rosiglitazone was inferior to metformin in lowing patients' weight with a significant difference (SMD=0.34, 95%CI 0.11 to 0.58, P=0.004). The rosiglitazone showed a lower incidence rate of adverse reaction compared with metformin. Conclusion Compared with metformin, the rosiglitazone is eqully effective in improving PCOS patients' insulin sensitivity and lowering androgen levels, and has a lower incidence rate of adverse reaction although it is inferior to metformin in lowing patients' weight. So rosiglitazone is more applicable for the patients who are of underweight or cannot tolerate the gastrointestinal side effects induced by metformin. There is no enough evidence for this conclusion due to the small sample size and limited number of RCTs. More high-quality, largesample and multicentered RCTs are required to guide clinical treatment and benefit patients.

Efficacy of chinese patent medicine tian gui capsule in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome: A randomized controlled trial,"Kuek S., Wang W.-J., Gui S.-Q.","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex hormonal disorder and one of the most common reproductive endocrinology abnormalities in women. Recently, many studies have been conducted assessing Chinese herbal medicine as an alternative treatment for women with PCOS, it is, therefore, worthwhile to analyze and observe the curative effects of traditional Chinese medicine treatment in PCOS. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of the Chinese patent medicine Tian Gui Capsule, in women with PCOS and compare its effects with metformin and ethinyl estradiol plus cyproterone acetate (Diane-35). Design, setting, participants and intervention; A total of 47 PCOS outpatients from the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University were randomly divided into 3 groups. Patients in group A (n = 19) were given Tian Gui Capsule, patients in group B (n = 17) were given metformin, and patients in group C (n = ll) were given Diane-35. The 3 groups of patients were treated for 3 months. Main outcome measures: Serum testosterone (T), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels, free androgen index (FAI), fasting blood glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), insulin sensitive index (ISO and left and right ovary volumes of the 3 groups were evaluated before and after treatment. Results: After 3 months of treatment, when compared with before treatment data, group A patients showed decreased serum T and SHBG levels, FAI, FINS, and left and right ovary volumes (P<0.05), and increased serum DHEA-S (P<0.05), while the FPG level showed no significant change. Although the level of serum T and FINS among the 3 groups after the treatment were similar, group A demonstrated better results than group B in reducing the FAI and increasing the serum SHBG, but less significant results than group C besides, group B was the only group showed improved insulin sensitivity. Although the level of FPG of the 3 groups after treatment were similar, group C had the most increased FPG. Conclusion; The effects of Tian Gui Capsule on hyperandrogenism are not as significant as Diane-35, but more effective than metformin. The effects of Tian Gui Capsule on hyperinsulinemia are not as significant as metformin but better than Diane-35. Tian Gui Capsule treats PCOS by regulating ovarian functions and reducing blood insulin level without inhibiting the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Further studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm the above results.","diane (60528-19-0), glucose (50-99-7, 84778-64-3), insulin (9004-10-8), metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9), prasterone (53-43-0), testosterone (58-22-0)",,10.3736/jcim20110907,http://dx.doi.org/10.3736/jcim20110907,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L362634478&from=export,,"Copyright 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Effects of Bushen Tongmai recipe on expression of IRS-1 Ser307 in polycystic ovarian syndrome rats accompanying with insulin resistance,"Xie Y., Huang D., Li Q., Lu F., Xu L., Zou X., Zhao Y.","Objective: To investigate the effects of Bushen Tongmai recipe on the phosphorylation expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 Ser307 (IRS-1 Ser307) in insulin target tissues of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) rats accompanying with insulin resistance (IR). Method: Rats of model of PCOS accompanying with IR were randomly divided into the model group and the traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) group. Meanwhile, a group of 13 rats of the same age was considered as the normal control group. The TCM group was administered with BSTMR. Half of each group was given insulin injection through portal vein in late estrus. Another half didnt receive insulin injection. The phosphorylation levels of IRS-1 Ser307 in liver and fatty tissues were measured by Western blot. The phosphorylation level of IRS-1 Ser307 in ovary tissue was measured by immunohistochemistry. Result: The phospharylation expressions of IRS-1 Ser307 in liver, fat and ovary in the model group were higher than those in the normal group (P<0.05, P<0.01); those criteria in the TCM group were lower than those in the model group(P<0.05). After insulin stimulation, the phospharylation expressions of IRS-1 Ser307 were higher than those before insulin stimulation (P<0.05). Conclusion: Bushen Tongmai recipe could attenuate the phospharylation expression of IRS-1 Ser307 and then enhance insulin signal transduction, which may be one of the mechanisms of Bushen Tongmai recipe in improving PCOS accompanying with IR.","insulin (9004-10-8), insulin receptor substrate 1 (175335-32-7)",,10.4268/cjcmm20100521,http://dx.doi.org/10.4268/cjcmm20100521,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L359008397&from=export,,"Copyright 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
Spearmint herbal tea has significant anti-androgen effects in polycystic ovarian syndrome. A randomized controlled trial,Grant P.,"Hirsutism in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), consequent to elevated androgen levels leads to significant cosmetic and psychological problems. Recent research in Turkey has shown that spearmint tea has antiandrogenic properties in females with hirsutism. No research has yet been undertaken to assess whether a reduction in androgen levels brought about by spearmint tea, translates to a clinical improvement in the degree of hirsutism. This study was a two centre, 30 day randomized controlled trial. Forty two volunteers were randomized to take spearmint tea twice a day for a 1 month period and compared with a placebo herbal tea. At 0, 15 and 30 days of the study serum androgen hormone levels and gonadotrophins were checked, the degree of hirsutism was clinically rated using the Ferriman-Galwey score and a questionnaire (the modified DQLI = Dermatology Quality of Life Index) was used to assess improvements in the level of self-reported hirsutism. Forty one of 42 patients completed the study. Free and total testosterone levels were significantly reduced over the 30 day period in the spearmint tea group (p < 0.05). LH and FSH also increased (p < 0.05). Patient's subjective assessments of their degree of hirsutism scored by the modified DQLI were significantly reduced in the spearmint tea group (p < 0.05). There was, however, no significant reduction in the objective Ferriman-Galwey ratings of hirsutism between the two trial groups over the trial duration (p = 0.12). There was a clear and significant alteration in the relevant hormone levels. This is associated clinically with a reduction in the self-reported degree of hirsutism but unfortunately not with the objectively rated score. It was demonstrated and confirmed that spearmint has antiandrogen properties, the simple fact that this does not clearly translate into clinical practice is due to the relationship between androgen hormones and follicular hair growth and cell turnover time. Simply put, the study duration was not long enough. The original studies from Turkey were in fact only 5 days long. The time taken for hirsutism to resolve is significant and a much longer future study is proposed as the preliminary findings are encouraging that spearmint has the potential for use as a helpful and natural treatment for hirsutism in PCOS.

Study of Serum Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) After Cyproterone Compound Treatment Compared With Oral Contraceptives Pill in Hirsute Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Patients,,"Brief SummaryThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of oral contraceptive on the serum free prostatic specific antigen (PSA)in women with polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOD)compared with cyproterone compound.Detailed DescriptionThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of oral contraceptive on the serum free prostatic specific antigen (PSA)in women with polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOD)compared with cyproterone compound. This randomized clinical trial included 60 polycystic ovary syndrome patients with hirsutism who were referred to infertility and reproductive health research center and governmental public educational hospital from Feb2007 till Dec 2007. Polycystic ovary syndrome was defined as the diagnostic criteria of 2003 census Rotterdam. Hirsutism was defined as the presence of excessive hair in body and Ferriman -Gallway scores more than 7. Women who received hormone therapy during the last 3 months, on a diet or herbal treatment were excluded from the study. The other exclusion criterion's consisted of Hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disorders, ovarian tumors and Cushing disease. Hirsutism was determined by the Ferriman-Gallway score and recorded for every patient. Blood samples for serum PSA, and the hormonal profile including free testosterone, dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate(DHEAS) and 17-hydroxyprogesterone(17-OHP) were taken at baseline and at the end of the treatment at the early follicular phase between 3th to 5th days of menstrual cycle at 8 AM. Patients were divided randomly in two treatment groups according to the computer based table. one group received oral contraceptive pills and the other one received cyproterone acetate combined ethinyl-estradiol(Diane) for 3 months. Hirsutism score was evaluated after treatment again. The blood samples were taken during the early follicular phase after 3 months of treatment to avoid pharmacological effect of treatment and serum PSA, free testosterone, DHEAS,17-OHP were measured again.

Combined therapy of Chinese medicine with in vitro fertilization and embryo transplantation for treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome,"Lian F., Sun Z.G., Zhang J.W.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity of Chinese drugs for reinforcing Shen and regulating Chong channel (RSRCC) on patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) undergoing in vitro fertilization and embryo transplantation (IVF-ET). METHODS: Sixty-four patients with PCOS undergoing IVF-ET were randomly assigned to two groups, the treated group (36 cases) and the control group (28 cases), to the former, Chinese recipe for RSRCC was given additionally. RESULTS: On the human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) injecting day, the percentage of three-line sign of endometrium (type A) in the treated group was 75.0% (27/36), which was higher than that in the control group (42.9%, 12/28), showing significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.01). The rates of mature oocytes, fertilization, high-qualified embryo rate, clinical pregnancy rate and incidence rate of ovary hyper-stimulating syndrome (OHSS) in the treated group were (76.8 +/- 8.2)%, (73.5 +/- 8.9)%, (89.4 +/- 14.4)%, 36.11% (13/36) and 5.56% (2/36), respectively; whereas those in the control group (64.4 +/- 8.7)%, (68.2 +/- 10.0)%, (79.5 +/- 15.2)%, 21.43% (6/28) and 10.71% (3/28); the dosage of gonadotrophin administered in the treated group was 33.8 +/- 12.5 ampoules, and in the control group 47.6 +/- 18.2 amp oules, statistical significance was shown between groups in comparing all the above-mentioned parameters (P <0.05, P <0.01). However, the number of oocytes obtained in the two groups was insignificantly different (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Combined use of Chinese drugs for RSRCC in IVF-ET can reduce the dosage of gonadotrophin administered and raise the clinical pregnant rate.",,,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L355898031&from=export,,MEDLINEÂ® is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.
Treatment of refractory polycystic ovary syndrome by bushen huoxue method combined with ultrasound-guided follicle aspiration,"Liang R.N., Liu J., Lu J.","OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effect of traditional Chinese medicine Bushen Houxue (BSHX) method combined with ultrasound-guided follicle aspiration (MFA) in treating refractory polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHODS: Forty-four patients with PCOS were randomly assigned to two groups by randomizing digital table, 20 in the observation group and 24 in the control group. MFA was performed on both groups, and the decoction of BSHX, which consisted of dodder seed 20 g, prepared rehmannia root 10 g, mulberry mistletoe 20 g, epimedium 15 g, psoralea fruit 10 g, solomonseal rhizome 10 g, honeylocust thorn 15 g, peach kernel 10 g, pleione bulbocodioides 10 g, red sage root 20 g, and licorice root 6 g, was given to the observation group one dose every day for 14 days every menstrual cycle. Changes of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone (T) were determined before and after MFA. The impacts on quantity of HMG used, number of sinus follicle, mature follicle, incidence of ovarian hyperstimulating syndrome (OHSS), luteinized unrupture follicular syndrome (LUFS) and pregnance rate were also observed. RESULTS: MFA had been performed for 42 cycles in the observation group and 56 cycles in the control group. Levels of T, LH and LH/FSH ratio markedly reduced after aspiration, showing significant difference as compared with those of before treatment in both groups (P < 0.01), and difference of LH/FSH between groups was of statistical significance (P <0.01). In the observation group, 18 patients (90.0%) had their sinus follicle decreased to < 10 after MFA, while in the control group, it reached to <10 in 22 patients (91.70%), all were different to those before treatment (P <0.01). In the observation group, the quantity of HMG used for promoting ovulation was (585.0 +/- 195.0) IU, number of mature follicle at the day of HCG injection was 1.1 +/- 0.3, while in the control group, the corresponding data were (1470.0 +/- 532.5) IU and 3.1 +/- 1.4, all with significant difference between groups (P <0.01). None of OHSS and 1 case of LUFS occurred in the former group, while 1 mild OHSS and 2 LUFS in the latter. After ovulation promoting therapy and in the 3-month secutive follow-up period, pregnancy was found in 8 out of the 18 patients in the observation group (one twins and 7 single), with the pregnancy rate of 44.4%; while in the control group, 7 in 22 (2 twins and 5 single) was found, the pregnancy rate being 31.8%. CONCLUSION: BSHX method combined with MFA is a safe and effective treatment for refractory PCOS, with few trauma. The combined usage of Chinese herbal medicine could significantly reduce dosage of HMG used for promoting follicle and the production of multiple mature follicles, thus to avoid the risk of OHSS.","follitropin (9002-68-0), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9)",,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L550359395&from=export,,MEDLINEÂ® is the source for the citation and abstract of this record.
Effects of switching to Wen-jing-tang (Unkei-to) from preceding herbal preparations selected by eight-principle pattern identification on endocrinological status and ovulatory induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome,"Ushiroyama T., Hosotani T., Mori K., Yamashita Y., Ikeda A., Ueki M.","The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of switching therapy to Wen-jing-tang (Unkei-to) from previous selected herbal preparations on endocrine levels and induction of ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Sixty-four anovulatory women diagnosed with PCOS were enrolled in the study. After Kampo diagnosis, subjects received matched Kampo preparations (43 cases: Dang-gui-shao-yao-san, 21 cases: Gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan) selected by the matching theory of eight-principle pattern identification and Kampo diagnosis based on concepts of the qi, blood, and fluids as the physiologic activity. Fifty-four women who failed to ovulate after an 8-week treatment were randomly allocated to continuation of treatment with the preceding Kampo prescription (continuation group, n = 27) or treatment with Wen-jing-tang (switching group, n = 27). Plasma FSH, LH and estradiol levels were measured and ovulation rates were determined at the beginning and after an 8-week treatment with the preceding Kampo prescription, as well as after the subsequent 8-week treatment with the same preparation or Wen-jing-tang. No decrease in mean plasma LH level was observed in the 54 women who failed to ovulate among the 64 treated with a Kampo preparation. After the 8-week treatment with Wen-jing-tang, plasma LH levels were decreased by 58.2% (p < 0.0001) and 49.4% (p < = 0.0005) in the groups switched from Dang-gui-shao-yao-san and Gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan, respectively. In the group switched from Dang-gui-shao-yao-san, a tendency towards increase in plasma estradiol level was observed (1.51-fold, p = 0.055), which was significant compared with that in the group switched from Gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan (p = 0.032). The ovulation rate with switching of treatment to Wen-jing-tang was significantly higher (59.3%) than that with continued use of the same preparation (7.4%, p = 0.0036). This study confirmed that Wen-jing-tang was effective in improving endocrine condition in the treatment of disturbances of ovulation in patients with PCOS without taking eight-principle pattern identification into consideration. This finding indicates that Wen-jing-tang is appropriate for use in treating PCOS in women with various constitutions (as determined by the matching theory of eight-principle pattern identification) in clinical practice and may prove to be a potent therapeutic agent with a wide therapeutic spectrum.

Clinical study of yishen jianpi yangxue tongli therapy in treating polycystic ovary syndrome,"Hua L., Wu Y.N., Zhang J.M.","OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Yishen Jianpi Yangxue Tongli Therapy (YJYTT) in treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to explore the therapeutic mechanism of YJYTT. METHODS: One hundred and seven PCOS patients with syndrome differentiation of TCM as Pi-Shen Yang deficiency were randomly divided into two groups, the treated group (n = 76) was treated with Chinese herbal medicine, while the control group (n = 31) was treated by clomiphen. The therapeutic effect in both groups and the change of body mass index (BMI), Ferriman-Gallway (F-G) score, serum sex hormones and serum oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) before and after treatment were observed. RESULTS: The comparison of total effective rate between two groups was insignificantly different, but the pregnancy rate of the treated group (65.7%) was markedly higher than that of control group (25.0%, P < 0.01). Also, significant difference was shown in the aspect of BMI, F-G score, serum testosterone (T), luteinizing hormone (LH) and OGTT, etc. between the two groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The YJYTT could markedly improve the clinical symptoms and pregnancy rate of PCOS patients, particularly showing good effect to the clomiphen resistant patients.

"Effects of unkei-to, an herbal medicine, on endocrine function and ovulation in women with high basal levels of luteinizing hormone secretion","Ushiroyama T., Ikeda A., Sakai M., Hosotani T., Suzuki Y., Tsubokura S., Ueki M.","OBJECTIVE: To treat anovulatory women with high plasma LH levels with unkei-to. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 100 patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (n = 38) or non-polycystic ovary syndrome (n = 62) were allocated randomly into two groups. Endocrine levels (FSH, LH and estradiol), follicle growth and response to unkei-to were compared for 52 subjects in the unkei-to group and 48 subjects in the control group. RESULTS: Unkei-to induced significant decreases in plasma LH in polycystic ovary syndrome and non-polycystic ovary syndrome with high LH levels. Plasma estradiol levels increased significantly (43.5%) in eight weeks of treatment with unkei-to. Significant development of the dominant follicle was also observed in patients treated with unkei-to. When women suffering from ovulatory failure or irregular menstruation and having high plasma LH concentration were treated with unkei-to for eight weeks, a reduction in the serum LH level of at least 1 SD from baseline was noted in 45.5% of polycystic ovary syndrome patients and in 80.0% of non-polycystic ovary syndrome patients. The mean rate of reduction of serum LH was 22.2 Â± 35.7% in polycystic ovary syndrome patients and 49.7 Â± 15.3% in non-polycystic ovary syndrome patients. This reduction was significant in the non-polycystic ovary syndrome patients (P =.030). The rate of menstrual cycle improvement, including successful ovulation, was 50.0% in the polycystic ovary syndrome group and 60.0% in the non-polycystic ovary syndrome group, with no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that unkei-to may regulate the pituitary response to GnRH or beneficially affect steroid production in the ovaries, inducing normalization of the diencephalon-pituitary-ovarian endocrine system in anovulatory women who have high plasma LH levels.","ethinylestradiol (57-63-6), follitropin (9002-68-0), luteinizing hormone (39341-83-8, 9002-67-9), norgestrel (6533-00-2)",,,,https://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L32489130&from=export,,"Copyright 2009 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
